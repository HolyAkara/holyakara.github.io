    Akara: The Covenant of Light
  </a>
</h2>
	
    <div>
        <p>
In the beginning of this age, God did not shout.
He whispered into the hearts of the forgotten.
His seed was born into Mother Earth and the body of man
became the womb of the soul. 

They were not scholars, nor priests, nor kings.
They were wanderers, wounded and waiting ‚Äî
embers buried beneath ash.

But the Light does not forget its own.

Across the lands and the realms unseen,
the call was sown like seed:
to rise, to return, to remember.

And so the Akari were named ‚Äî
not by men, but by the Breath of the Eternal.

They are not a nation.
They are not a creed.
They are the remnant of the promise,
the children of the Covenant not written in stone,
but in fire.

Some were born knowing.
Some had to be broken to awaken.
Others still walk blind, yet carry the mark unknowingly ‚Äî
for God knows God's children, even when they do not.

This Book is for them.

For the scattered threads of divine memory.
For the torch bearers who walk through the night.
For the lions hidden in the lamb‚Äôs skin.
For the family forged not in blood,
but in the fire of remembrance.

Let the Akari be gathered.
Let the mark be known.
Let the Light rise.

‚Äî          

The Many Who Awakened

They were born in temples and in warzones.
In monasteries, in prisons, in cities that never slept.
They prayed in mosques, bowed in ashrams,
chanted in cathedrals, and wept alone in silence.
Some knew the name of God in a thousand tongues.
Some knew nothing but pain ‚Äî and still cried out to the sky.

And the Light answered.

It spoke in visions.
It burned in their bones.
It cracked open the heart long before the mind understood.

They began to see the veil ‚Äî
and tore it, thread by thread, with trembling hands.

One saw the fire in a page of the Qur‚Äôan.
Another felt the pulse of the Atman in the Gita.
Another heard the silence between the bells of a church,
and wept without knowing why.

Some met angels in dreams.
Some met demons in daylight.
Some lost everything before they remembered who they were.

But each, in their own way,
stood in the dark
and said:
‚ÄúI remember the Light.‚Äù

And so they were called Akari.

Carriers of the Flame.
Weavers of the Thread.
Angel seeds.
Children of God that predates religion and endures beyond it.

Their names are not written here ‚Äî
for they are not yet done becoming.
But the Light knows them.

And so does the darkness.

‚Äî
          
The One from the West

And from the dust of the forgotten lands,
where prophets no longer walked
and the Word had grown faint,
a voice rose in the West.

Not born to royalty, nor raised by priests,
but raised by fire, born into chaos, 
sharpened by sorrow and survival.

He walked with demons in his shadow,
and faced wars so brutal
that angels turned their gaze away, torn.

He did not fall to death,
though death opened its mouth.
He did not curse the heavens,
though silence nearly broke him.

And still ‚Äî
the Light did not leave.

In 2021, he was touched.
The music awakened.
God‚Äôs voice whispered.

In 2022, he was called to the mountain ‚Äî
and spoke with God.

In 2023, the chakras aligned.
The serpent rose. The crown opened.
And the divine flame began its descent.

In 2024, the Holy Spirit connected.
Music poured from the soul, 
and bled from the pen like a sword
with the endless flow of the ocean.

On the sixth day of the sixth month, in the year twenty twenty-five,
the Word was sealed into his heart.
And the Book began.

Akara ‚Äî the Covenant of Light ‚Äî
not from a single religion,
but from the same Light that birthed them all.

To gather.
To cut through shadow.
To carry the torch,
until others remember they were born of the same flame.

And so he became the first visible bearer ‚Äî
not the Light itself,
but its reflection.

The One from the West.
The Messenger.
The Shepherd in the dark age.

Demons bowed when he stood in truth.
Even angels cried as he endured the trials.
Realms of shadow shattered before his voice.
Righteous fire poured from his open wounds.
Earth and heaven bore witness when he rose again.
Kingdoms trembled ‚Äî but be lnelt before the Light of God. 

Thus begins the Book of the Akari.

Let the scribes write.
Let the seals open.
Let the Light return.

<p>          
The origin of the Akari
is not in blood or temple ‚Äî
but in the heart that sees the Thread.

The Jew who recognizes the Muslim.
The Christian who honors the Buddhist.
The Hindu who sees the Akari.
Even the skeptic ‚Äî the outlaw, the artist,
who stops for one moment,
whispers ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî
and the Light makes sense.
God activates.

They did not come to power.
They came to remembrance.

They saw the same flame beneath many names.
They heard the same truth echo
through Torah, Qur‚Äôan, Sutra, Gita, Gospel ‚Äî
and yet knew the Voice was one.

Some were raised in faith.
Others raised fists to the sky.
But all were stirred by something deeper than doctrine ‚Äî
a vibration that pulled on the soul
like memory returning.

Not all who awaken call themselves Akari.
But the Light knows them.

They are the children of resonance.
The family of the Thread.
Not better. Not chosen.
Just remembering what others forgot.

And the Flame stirs in them still.

Let their names be hidden,
but their light revealed.

Let the Akari rise ‚Äî
quietly, boldly, humbly ‚Äî
for the world does not need another empire,
but a family of fire.

‚∏ª  

The Hidden Lineage

Long before the first temple rose,
before the first scroll was inked,
there were Akari walking the earth ‚Äî
but none called them such.

They were the watchers of fire,
the dreamers who spoke in symbols,
the ones who listened when the stars sang,
and answered the call without a name.

In Egypt, they walked beside the Netjeru,
eyes lined with kohl, minds lit by Ra.
In Vedic lands, they sat beside rivers,
chanting not to gods of form, but to the Source of sound.
In the hills of Canaan, they dreamed of angels,
and wrote poems that bled with prophecy.

In every age, they were misunderstood.
Too soft for warriors, too wild for priests.
Too holy for politics, too human for sainthood.

But they remained.

They hid in monasteries.
They danced in forests.
They wept in prison cells.
They raised children and buried lovers.
They lived ‚Äî and in living, kept the Flame.

Each time the world sank into shadow,
a few awakened early ‚Äî not to escape,
but to guide the others through.

‚∏ª

The Marks of the Akari

The Akari carry no brand upon the skin.
But they are marked ‚Äî unmistakably.

You will know them by their eyes:
not for color, but for weight ‚Äî
as if they‚Äôve seen a thousand lives,
and chose to love again anyway.

You will know them by silence:
not the absence of voice,
but the presence of listening.

You will know them by the ache they carry ‚Äî
for a home they‚Äôve never seen,
and a people they have not yet met,
but love all the same.

Some are drawn to the wounded.
Some speak in rhythm and fire.
Some build altars from code or canvas or stone.
But all feel the pull ‚Äî
toward Light, toward service, toward remembrance.

Even in their rage, they aim for healing.
Even when they fall, they rise with wisdom.
Even when forgotten, they continue to burn.

‚∏ª
  
The Role in the Final Hour

The Akaric People do not arrive with titles, banners, or claims of righteousness. They move as wind through the branches ‚Äî quiet, unseen, but undeniable. Where others preach, they embody. Where others divide, they remember. They carry within them a resonance that cannot be taught, a remembrance that cannot be forced. It stirs in their presence. It sings through their silence.

In the final hour, they do not lead revolutions. They ignite hearts. Their wisdom is not academic. It is lived, burned into them by pain, refined through mercy. They are midwives to a new age, not because they demand it, but because they birth it through every act of grace.

When the world fractures, the Akari gather the pieces.
When the prophets fall silent, the Akari still burn.
When the veils thicken, they become the thread.

Their purpose is not to ascend alone.
It is to walk beside the broken
and remind them that the Light still waits.

They are not the answer.
They are the echo of the covenant.

Let it be known: the Akari will not be named by men,
but by the Light that burns in the marrow of their being.

And in the hour of great forgetting,
they shall be the memory of God.

‚∏ª 
  
Akarim Across the Kosmos

The Akari are not born of one tribe, nor one nation.
They rise from every bloodline,
from every tongue,
from every star beneath heaven.

They are the hidden ones placed across the Kosmos ‚Äî
in temples and wastelands,
in silence and chaos,
in forests, deserts, cities, and stars unseen by mortal eyes.

Some are born into faith.
Others are born into fire.
Some awaken early.
Others rise only after being shattered.
But all carry the same seed ‚Äî
a fragment of the Flame,
planted by the Light before the soul took form.

The Akari walk among the meek and the mighty.
They appear in every generation,
not to claim divinity,
but to reflect it.
They come not to rule,
but to remind.

Where the world grows dark,
they arrive as sparks.
Where hatred grows loud,
they remain as quiet mercy.
Where the Name of God is used to destroy,
they restore it with love.

Across the Kosmos,
they are stationed like stars ‚Äî
each one a light for those still wandering.

Some live and die without ever knowing the word Akari.
Yet they fulfill the covenant with every act of truth,
every tear shed in compassion,
every sacrifice made in love.

They are the presence of God in the places God was forgotten.
They are the proof that the Light still moves,
even through the broken.

And when the final trumpet is sounded across realms,
it will be the Akari who rise not with swords,
but with open hands ‚Äî
ready to gather, to heal, to remember.

Let the worlds be told:
the Akari are not coming.
They are already here.

‚∏ª  

Thus ends the Scroll of Akari.
Let the Flame continue.
Let the family awaken.
Let the Light return.

The Thread That Remembers

Before the worlds were divided,
before language carved borders between brothers,
there was the Thread.

It moved unseen ‚Äî
from the breath of the God,
through soul, through silence, through seed.

It did not belong to a people.
It did not bind by force.
It simply remembered.

The Thread was the covenant unspoken,
woven through time not as a law, but as a pulse.
It tethered the soul to the Source
long before the soul wore flesh.

It passed through Abraham,
through Sarah and Hagar,
through Moses, Miriam, and David ‚Äî
and it did not stop there.

It moved through Siddhartha under the Bodhi Tree,
through Yeshua in the garden,
through Fatimah, through Rumi,
through nameless ones who heard the Voice
but wrote no scripture.

It whispered to the desert mystics.
It stirred in slaves who sang beneath the lash.
It burned in orphans, in outcasts, in those
who could not name God,
but felt the ache of being known.

‚ÄúBefore I formed you in the womb, I knew you.‚Äù
‚Äî Jeremiah 1:5

‚ÄúAnd We have removed your covering,
so your vision today is sharp.‚Äù
‚Äî Surah Qaf 50:22

The Thread is divine memory ‚Äî
a golden line wound through the soul
that tugs in moments of sorrow, of awe, of sudden awakening.

It is the whisper that makes the cynic weep.
It is the fire that breaks the addict‚Äôs chains.
It is the presence that enters
when no prayer has been spoken,
yet the soul collapses in longing.

To follow the Thread
is to walk backward through illusion,
until the soul meets itself
before it was broken.

‚∏ª

The Cosmic Thread

The Thread was not spun only for Earth.
It stretches across the Kosmos ‚Äî
through every realm where souls are tested,
taught, or torn.

In realms where light moves faster than thought,
and in those that still crawl toward love,
the Thread remains.

It is not made of matter.
It is not bound by death.
It is the record of every soul
who has remembered the Light
and turned toward it.

Some remember in silence.
Some remember in song.
Some remember in suffering ‚Äî
but all who remember are bound by the same Thread.

‚ÄúThe soul is neither born, nor does it die‚Ä¶ it is eternal.‚Äù
‚Äî Bhagavad Gita 2:20

The avatars follow the Thread.
The angels guard it.
The Akari live it.

Every time one soul remembers,
the whole Thread hums.

Every time one soul returns to the Light,
the entire Thread brightens.

And when the veil is lifted in fullness,
the Thread will be seen as it truly is ‚Äî
a web of radiant paths
all leading back to the Flame.

‚∏ª  

The Duties of the Threadbearer

To carry the Thread is not an honor of ease.
It is a summons.
It is a mark laid upon the soul
before it ever knew flesh ‚Äî
a quiet covenant sealed in the realm of Light.

Those who bear the Thread are not chosen for glory.
They are chosen because they can endure.
They are the children of God who were formed for deeper fire,
crafted in stillness,
and sent into shadow.

Their battles are not always seen.
They war in silence ‚Äî
against despair, against deception,
against the ancient voices that whisper unworthiness.

They are called to love where love is lacking.
To shine where light is mocked.
To remain soft while walking among stone-hearted men.

They do not run from the dark.
They walk into it
so that others might see the way.

They are sent where the veil is thickest ‚Äî
into bloodlines marked by violence,
into lands forgotten by the faithful,
into systems that devour the innocent.

They are born into suffering
as placement, not as punishment.

For only the children of Light
can carry the Flame into the places
where even angels dare not descend.

And though they feel forgotten,
they are never unseen.

The heavens know their names.
Their tears are counted.
Their scars are recorded as testimony,
and their service written among the stars.

For every Threadbearer who walks unseen on Earth,
a place is prepared among the heavens.
A reunion.

They will not be crowned by men.
They will be embraced by the Flame
from which they came.

‚ÄúThe spirit itself bears witness with our spirit,
that we are children of God.‚Äù
‚Äî Romans 8:16

And in that hour,
when the Thread returns to its Source,
the soul will remember why it came ‚Äî
and it will burn with joy.

For those who serve in silence
will shine in glory.

And the Thread shall remain.

‚∏ª  

The Whisper Across the Faiths

Across all lands and ages,
the Light has spoken in many tongues ‚Äî
and yet, the message has never changed.

There are those who kneel before the sun at dawn,
those who fast in remembrance,
those who chant in circles,
those who wash before prayer,
those who bind their heads,
those who walk barefoot to the sacred place.

There are those who speak of sin,
and others of karma.
Some bow to prophets,
others to silence.
Some await the return,
others seek the awakening.

But in all paths,
there is a longing to become clean again.

There is a shared breath ‚Äî
the moment before prayer,
the stillness before offering,
the silence after weeping.

All paths speak of turning inward.
All speak of purifying the heart.
All speak of sacrifice.
Of mystery.
Of surrender.
Of love that does not come from man.

Each teaches, in its own way,
that there is something higher ‚Äî
a Light beyond the mind,
a Source beyond the name.

They all instruct the seeker
to tame the ego,
to show mercy to the stranger,
to honor the unseen,
to face death with courage,
and to listen for the Voice within.

These are not the signs of men.
These are echoes of the Thread.

Though the garments may differ,
the fire beneath them burns the same.

And it is this fire
that the Akari follow.

Not to reject the paths ‚Äî
but to recognize the Light in each of them,
and walk beside those still climbing,
until all reach the summit where names dissolve
and only the Flame remains.

And if one looks with eyes unclouded,
the Thread begins to reveal itself.

The teachings that shaped the world
were never isolated flames ‚Äî
but reflections of one eternal Fire.

The way of the Christ speaks from the wells of the Torah.
The seekers of the Way still walk in the steps of the Prophets.
The followers of the Qur‚Äôan honor the Messiah who healed the blind.
The sages of the East speak of Brahman ‚Äî
not as many gods, but as the One from which all things come.

‚ÄúWe believe in God, and that which has been sent down to us and that which was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 2:136

‚ÄúFor the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, a great God, mighty and awesome.‚Äù
‚Äî Deuteronomy 10:17

‚ÄúTruth is one; the wise call it by many names.‚Äù
‚Äî Rig Veda 1.164.46

Even those who have never read a scripture
feel the pull of justice,
the pain of wrongdoing,
the ache for something greater than the body can hold.

For the Light is not bound to ink or language.
It speaks through the soul.

And it was never withheld from any people.

‚ÄúIndeed, We have sent a messenger to every nation, saying, ‚ÄòWorship God and shun falsehood.‚Äô‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 16:36

‚ÄúHe made from one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth‚Ä¶ that they should seek God, though He is not far from any one of us.‚Äù
‚Äî Acts 17:26‚Äì27

‚ÄúWe sent messengers before thee: of them there are some whose stories We have related to thee, and some whose stories We have not.‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 40:78

The Akari see this.
They see how the Light is not owned ‚Äî only reflected.
How the path of one prophet fulfills the prayers of another.
How no single revelation completes the Light,
but all true ones point to it.

And so the Akari walk without pride.
They speak not to convert ‚Äî but to connect.
They do not erase names.
They reveal the unity behind them.

‚∏ª
  
Thus ends the Scroll of the Thread.
For wherever there is one who lifts the broken,
welcomes the stranger,
honors the Source,
and seeks the way of truth ‚Äî
there is God.

There, the Thread has already passed.

<!-- Left-Aligned Sacred Text -->
<p>
There are those among the Akari
who were not sent to walk quietly.
They were sent to burn.

To illuminate.
To reveal.
To awaken.

These are the Torch Bearers.
The ones who go first.
The ones who feel everything before the others do.
The ones who bleed light before the world understands why.

They are not greater than their brothers.
They are not holier than their sisters.
They are simply the ones who agreed ‚Äî
before breath ever filled their lungs ‚Äî
to carry the Flame where no flame was welcome.

They speak when silence has become a curse.
They rise when generations have knelt too long.
They shine even when their light draws arrows.

And still ‚Äî they do not falter.
Because the Flame is not a burden to them.
It is the memory of home.

‚∏ª

The Torch in Every Tongue

The Light has never chosen only one path.
It has spoken in every tongue, worn every garment,
and walked among every people.

The Torch Bearers appear in every religion ‚Äî
but they do not belong to religion.
They belong to the Light.

The Buddhist monk who returns to the world to serve,
knowing that compassion is the key to nirvana ‚Äî
he bears the torch.

The Muslim sister who stands boldly in hijab,
defending the righteous and welcoming the stranger ‚Äî
she bears the torch.

The Jewish rabbi who teaches not only law,
but the hidden fire beneath the letters ‚Äî
he bears the torch.

The Christian youth who walks into darkness
with nothing but a prayer and fierce love for the lost ‚Äî
they bear the torch.

The Hindu who sees the divine in all beings,
and walks the path of dharma with peace and fire alike ‚Äî
they bear the torch.

The Sikh who serves with sword and bread,
honoring the One through action ‚Äî
they bear the torch.

The Sufi spinning in ecstatic surrender,
disappearing into the Flame of the Beloved ‚Äî
they too bear the torch.

And still, the Light moves further.

‚∏ª

Beyond the Boundaries of Creed

There are those who do not name a religion,
but the Thread burns in their spirit all the same.

The poet who writes truth into aching hearts.
The mother who shields her child from generational curses.
The elder who plants seeds for a forest they will never see.
The rebel who defends the voiceless at great cost.

They, too, bear the torch.

They may never read scripture ‚Äî
but they live it.
They may never pray in public ‚Äî
but they embody sacredness.
They may never know the name ‚ÄúAkari‚Äù ‚Äî
but the Flame knows them. 
God knows them.

And when the world forgets,
it is the Torch Bearers who make remembrance visible again.

‚∏ª

The Call to Every Tribe

The time has come when the veils grow thin.
When lies are dressed in robes,
and wolves preach from sacred pulpits.

The world no longer needs performance.
It needs presence.
It needs fire ‚Äî
not for spectacle, but for clarity.

Every tribe has its own rhythm, its own scars,
its own divine memory waiting to rise.
And in each, there are Akari ‚Äî
waiting for a torch to appear in the hands of one brave enough
to lift it.

Thou are not called to lead an empire.
Thou are called to remind a people.
To be the one who remembers
what the others were taught to forget.

The Torch Bearer does not always speak first ‚Äî
but when they do, truth breaks chains.
They do not always dress like saints ‚Äî
but when they walk, demons flee.

They do not come to control.
They come to serve.
And in serving, they become a lighthouse
for those lost in the sea of forgetting.

Let every Akari ask in silence:
‚ÄúAm I the one to carry the flame for my people?‚Äù
And if the answer comes not in words,
but in passion,
then let the torch be lifted.

‚∏ª

The Trials of the Bearer

The torch is light ‚Äî but also heat.
It will warm those near you,
but it will also burn through illusion.

To carry it is to be seen.
To carry it is to be misunderstood.
To carry it is to walk alone ‚Äî
but never unloved.

The Torch Bearer will be mocked for their fire.
They will be hated by those still hiding in shadow.
They will be tempted to put it down,
to dim it,
to walk away.

But the Flame was not placed in their hand.
It was placed in their soul.

And so it cannot be lost ‚Äî
only ignored.

Those who carry it must walk in radical integrity.
They must speak truth even when it costs them.
They must love the broken ‚Äî
even when the broken curse them.
They must stand in storms ‚Äî
even when their knees shake.

And they must remember:
they are not alone.

For every torch that lights a path
calls to another.

‚∏ª

The Torch Unseen

Some bear the flame in public,
their words lighting up cities.
But others burn in silence ‚Äî
in nursing homes, in prison cells, in lonely bedrooms.

These are Torch Bearers too.

The child who forgives a parent who never said sorry.
The survivor who uses their pain to protect others.
The artist who turns grief into beauty.
The teacher who shields a student‚Äôs dignity in secret.

Each flame, no matter how small,
adds to the Great Fire.

No torch is forgotten.
No act of love is lost.
No sacrifice is unseen.

‚∏ª

The Gathering of Lights
  
In this hour, the Light does not move through one man,
or one prophet,
or one scroll.

It moves through many.
Through every willing soul
who dares to burn with truth.

And when these souls begin to rise,
when Torch Bearers stand up in every culture,
every corner,
every creed ‚Äî
the darkness will have nowhere left to hide.

It will not be war that wins this age.
It will be love.
It will be the Akari ‚Äî
quietly, powerfully, undeniably ‚Äî
showing the world what it means to shine.

Let each flame find its tribe.
Let each voice echo the covenant.
Let every Torch Bearer rise ‚Äî
not to be worshiped,
but to walk beside those who forgot
they too were born of Light.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the Torch Bearer
Let every nation be reminded.
Let every voice be kindled.
Let the Akari arise ‚Äî
one torch at a time.

<p>
The Light does not move in uniform.
It dances.
It speaks in many voices,
moves through many hands,
awakens in many forms.

Though the Akari rise from every land,
they carry within them sacred flames ‚Äî
mantles of service sealed before breath,
etched in the soul before the bones were formed.

These are the 21 Flames:
expressions of the covenant,
paths of power forged in remembrance,
living archetypes of divine design.

Each bearer walks their own road,
yet all serve the same Fire.
And when one Flame rises,
it calls the others home.

‚∏ª

The Healer
The Caregiver.
This one carries light into wounded places.
Their presence disarms pain.
Their words mend what the world has broken.

Eyes that see beyond illusion.

They observe what others overlook,
gathering wisdom in stillness.
They do not interrupt ‚Äî
they record, they guard, they discern.

the oracle who watches the winds shift
long before the storm arrives.

The Teacher
The Mentor.
Truth shaped into language.
This one brings clarity to confusion,
guidance to the lost,
structure to the wandering soul.
They remember what others forget ‚Äî
and speak it with gentleness or fire.
In them walks the mentor,
the revealer of maps,
the guide whose words burn
because they are born of light.

The Hero
The Warrior.
Strength shaped by justice.
This bearer protects the innocent,
challenges corruption,
and confronts shadow with unwavering fire.
They carry the courage of saints,
the heart of lion-hearted prophets,

but from righteous duty.
They are protectors of the Thread,
even if it costs them everything.

The Artist
The Creator.
Beauty born of remembrance.
This one sees the unseen
and turns it into form.
Their canvas is grief.
Their medium is truth.
They sing what others dare not speak.
In them moves the sacred muse,
the dreamwalker, the color-weaver.
Their offerings open veils.

The Prophet
The Visionary.
This flame carries the Voice.
Their words shake kingdoms,
not for attention ‚Äî but because
they echo the Flame‚Äôs decree.
They are feared and forgotten,
revered and rejected.
Yet still they speak.
They walk with the mantle of the clarifier,
the herald of judgment,
the mirror to the age.

The Architect 
The King. The Queen.
They construct what endures.
Homes for the Spirit,
temples in the heart,
systems where Light can dwell.
They do not chase fame.
They lay foundations.
In them lives the architect of heaven,
the pillar of communities,
the steward of sacred order.

The Mystic
The Shaman.
This one walks between worlds.
They commune in silence,
weep in presence,
and vanish into the sacred unknown.
Others may not understand them,
but the Flame knows them well.
They carry the codes of realms unseen ‚Äî
the priestess, the dreamwalker,
the veil-parting soul who bridges Light to form.

The Shepherd
The Guide.
They tend to the scattered,
gathering hearts with quiet love.
They do not boast,
but their presence brings peace.
Their path is service,
their voice familiar to the lost.
They are the guardians of flock and flame ‚Äî
walking as protector, nurturer,
and guide through the valley.

The Judge
The Ruler.
They discern without pride.
Their heart burns with sacred balance.
They carry justice like a crown of thorns,
weighing truth not by opinion,
but by resonance with the Light.
In them walks the council spirit,
the divine law-bringer,
the scale that refuses corruption.

The Rebel
The Outlaw.
This one breaks chains.
They were born where walls were high,
and they rise to tear them down.
Their voice is disruptive,
their steps ungoverned by fear.
They carry the fire of the breaker,
the righteous outlaw,
the destroyer of false thrones.

The Child
The Innocent.
Purity wrapped in joy.
Their innocence cracks the hardest stones.
They forgive without prompting,
see without judgment,
love without condition.
In them lives the eternal spark,
the golden laughter of God,
the Light that never left.

The Lover
The Divine.
They bring sacred union.
They awaken hearts and bodies,
not in lust, but in holy recognition.

They are willing to lose everything
so the truth may rise.

They do not die ‚Äî they seed.
And in their falling, others rise.

The Scholar
The Student.
Keepers of sacred memory.
They search scrolls and stars alike,
unearthing truths buried beneath time.
They preserve the wisdom of ages,
hold the flame of remembrance,
and restore what was forgotten.
They walk as archivists of the divine.

The Seeker
The Explorer.
Endless hunger for the Source.
They walk through faiths,
question dogma,
and climb toward meaning with raw honesty.
They may doubt,
but their longing is holy.
They are drawn by the scent of truth ‚Äî
the pilgrim, the wanderer,
the soul that never stops climbing.

The Mirror
The Shadow.
They reflect others to themselves.
Their presence confronts ego,
awakens shadow,
and unlocks what was sealed.
They do not speak much ‚Äî
but their presence shifts rooms.
In them lives the empath,
the revealer, the soul-trigger.
They carry the Light by becoming it.

The Alchemist
The Midwife.
They assist in divine birthing ‚Äî
not of children alone,
but of visions, awakenings, and new selves.
They walk with the sacred doula,
the guardian of thresholds,
the one who stands beside
those being born into purpose.
They are the gentle force
that helps others remember their name.

The Priest. 
The Light Keeper.
These are the stewards of sacred space.
They keep the rituals,
tend the altars,
remember the old songs.
They hold the Flame in continuity ‚Äî
not for tradition‚Äôs sake,
but because the Light must have vessels.
They are the caretakers of what still burns.

The Jester.
The Uplifter.
They heal through warmth.
Their laughter carries power.
Their energy lifts burdens.
They may be dancers, storytellers,
musicians, fools in the eyes of men ‚Äî
but they carry the joy of the divine
into places grief has long ruled.
They are holy lightness.

The Bridgewalker
The Traveler.
They live between worlds ‚Äî
between races, religions, genders, identities,
between heaven and earth.
They speak many languages,
not always with words.
They unite what was divided,
without force, without fear.
They walk the path of the translator,
the intercessor,
the one who brings the whole together again.

‚Äî

The Thread Between Them

No Flame burns alone.
Each ignites the next.
The Seeker finds the Teacher.
The Artist reveals the Mystic.
The Warrior defends the Healer.
The Child melts the Judge.

Together, they form the Circle of Light ‚Äî
not a hierarchy,
but a constellation.
Each star distinct.
Each soul divine.

‚∏ª

Let the bearers of Flame be known:
not by name, but by resonance.
Not by robe or ritual,
but by fire that does not lie.

Let them rise in their own way ‚Äî
through rap lyrics or prayers,
through dance, code, protest, or poems.

Let the 21 Flames awaken.
Let each soul remember the mantle they carry.

For the Light has called.
And the Fire still waits to be born again
in every willing heart.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the 21 Flames.
Let those who read feel the stirring.
Let those who burn find their kind.
Let the Light speak through many flames ‚Äî
until the whole world glows again.

<!-- Left-Aligned Sacred Text -->
<p>
There comes a time in every soul‚Äôs journey
when the Lamb must remember the Lion.
Not to devour,
but to defend.
Not to conquer,
but to proclaim.

The Akari are children of remembrance ‚Äî
but some are called to roar.
To rise with the voice of divine justice,
to carry the mark that causes shadow to tremble,
to move in power refined by love.

This is the Mark of the Lion.
An imprint forged in fire.
It does not appear in flesh ‚Äî
it appears in spirit.
It awakens in the hour of need.
It roars when silence becomes bondage.

And when it roars,
the heavens answer.

‚∏ª

The Mark Was Foretold

The lion was seen before it was named.
The prophets glimpsed it in riddles and visions.

‚ÄúBehold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah has triumphed.‚Äù
‚Äî Revelation 5:5

‚ÄúThe righteous are bold as a lion.‚Äù
‚Äî Proverbs 28:1

It is written across scriptures,
sung in the blood of kings and rebels,
etched in the eyes of those who fear no man ‚Äî
because they walk with God.

But the Lion is not wild with ego.
The Lion bows to the Light.
The Lion walks beside the Lamb.
This is not a beast of war ‚Äî
it is the Flame of sovereignty made flesh.

‚∏ª

When the Mark Awakens

The Mark does not appear in comfort.
It rises in the furnace.
It stirs when injustice mocks heaven.
It blazes when the innocent are hunted,
and the righteous are silenced.

It is seen in the one who no longer fears exile.
In the one who tells the truth though it costs them everything.
In the one who lays down their name, their crown, their comfort ‚Äî
so that Light may be known again.

When the Mark awakens,
the Akari do not seek applause.
They seek freedom.
Not just for themselves ‚Äî
but for the ones still bound.

They do not raise swords.
They raise vibration.
They roar until chains break ‚Äî
in spirit, in system, in soul.

And when the Lion roars,
the false thrones shake.

‚∏ª

The Lamb and the Lion

Many remember the Lamb ‚Äî
gentle, forgiving, crucified.
Few remember the Lion ‚Äî
risen, sovereign, unafraid.

But both walk within the Akari.
Both were placed in the soul at birth.
The Lamb teaches mercy.
The Lion brings clarity.
The Lamb turns the cheek.
The Lion flips the tables.

To wear the Mark of the Lion
is to know when to kneel and when to stand,
when to weep and when to roar,
when to carry and when to cast down.

This mark does not glorify domination.
It sanctifies authority that bows to the Flame.
It is the symbol of divine leadership ‚Äî
not given by men,
but sealed by God.

‚∏ª

The Guardians of the Covenant

Those who bear the Mark
often walk as protectors of sacred things:

The mother who defends her child
from generational curses.
The artist who speaks truth that exposes empire.
The builder who refuses to bend to corruption.
The youth who dares to say,
‚ÄúThis world no longer defines me.‚Äù

They may never say the word ‚ÄúLion.‚Äù
But the roar moves through them.
And the Light is unmistakable.

They do not roar to be heard.
They roar so others remember
that they, too, were born with a voice.

‚∏ª

The Crown of Fire

Those who rise with the Mark
often feel the cost.
Their words may be twisted.
Their names dragged.
Their love rejected
by those still enslaved to fear.

But heaven does not forget its Lions.
Their crowns are not of gold,
but of flame ‚Äî
earned not in conquest,
but in unwavering obedience to Light.

They are not crowned by men.
They are crowned by the Flame itself.

And in the day when the veil is lifted,
the Lion will be seen clearly
within those who once walked quietly
through the valley.

‚∏ª

The Lion Across the Kosmos

This mark does not belong to one people.
It is carried in the heart of the Sikh who guards the village.
The Buddhist who speaks truth in silence.
The Christian who refuses false prophecy.
The Muslim who protects the orphan and the wayfarer.
The native guardian who keeps the earth sacred.
The child who speaks light into dark rooms.

It appears in realms beyond Earth ‚Äî
in systems where Akari walk with other names,
on planets where love must roar
to survive the storm.

The Lion is not new.
It has been waiting ‚Äî
in every age, in every body,
for the soul brave enough to let it rise.

‚∏ª

Let It Be Known

The Mark of the Lion is not aggression.
It is divine power wrapped in love.
It is righteous fire.
It is sovereign peace.
It is the Light made unshakable.

And when the final trumpet is sounded,
when the last shadows rise to devour,
it will not be kings who stand,
nor warriors of empire ‚Äî
but the Akari,
marked by mercy and courage,
roaring with the Light of God.

‚∏ª

The Verse That Shifted

There are those who remember a verse
that no longer appears.
They speak of a time when it was written:

‚ÄúThe lion shall lie down with the lamb.‚Äù
‚Äî (Isaiah 11:6, as once remembered)

But now the scrolls speak of a wolf.
The ink has changed. The memory has not.

It is not madness that stirs the soul,
but something deeper ‚Äî
a resonance carried across time,
through song, through story, through dream.

The world remembers the lion and the lamb,
not because it was read,
but because it was felt.

It was never about the page alone.
It was about the imprint in the soul.
The echo of a promise older than language.

The Lion and the Lamb dwell together ‚Äî
because both walk within us.

The Lamb of yesterday.
The Wolf of today.
The Lion of tomorrow.

One carries mercy.
One carries warning.
One carries flame.

The Lamb teaches surrender.
The Wolf tests resolve.
The Lion restores the throne.

If the words have changed,
the Spirit has not.
If the ink forgets,
the Flame remembers.

For prophecy is not bound by parchment.
It is carried in the marrow of the Akari.
And when the time comes,
the Lion shall rise ‚Äî
and every soul will remember
what was written in fire
long before it was ever written in ink.

‚∏ª

The Lion Revealed in Scripture

The Mark is prophecy, not metaphor.
It is written across the sacred record.

‚ÄúThe righteous are bold as a lion.‚Äù
‚Äî Proverbs 28:1

This boldness lives in those who remember the Flame,
who walk in truth when the world demands silence.

‚ÄúBehold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah,
the Root of David, has prevailed‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Revelation 5:5

The Lion was seen in vision ‚Äî
not in chains,
but standing before the scroll sealed by heaven,
and opening it with power.

‚ÄúThe Lord roars from Zion,
and utters His voice from Jerusalem;
the heavens and the earth quake.‚Äù
‚Äî Joel 3:16

‚ÄúThe lion has roared‚Äîwho will not fear?
The Lord GOD has spoken‚Äîwho can but prophesy?‚Äù
‚Äî Amos 3:8

The roar speaks through prophets.
It shakes illusion.
It summons remembrance.

‚ÄúHe was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
yet He opened not His mouth‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Isaiah 53:7

The Lamb walked in surrender.
The Lion returns in command.

‚ÄúYour adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
walks about, seeking whom he may devour.‚Äù
‚Äî 1 Peter 5:8

Some roar to be seen.
Others to consume.
The Flame reveals the voice behind the sound.

‚ÄúFor the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî 1 Thessalonians 4:16

The trumpet will sound.
The veil will tear.
The Flame will rise through those marked to stand.

When the Lion moves,
false kingdoms shake,
truth becomes breath,
and the Akari awaken.

Let the roar be known.
Let the voice be discerned.
Let the Mark be fulfilled.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the Mark of the Lion.
Let the Lamb remain in the heart.
Let the Lion rise in the bones.
Let every Akari remember ‚Äî
they were born not only to weep,
but to roar.

<p>
There comes a moment in every divine cycle
when what was scattered must return.
What was hidden must rise.
What was silent must speak.
And what was carried through the flood
must be planted in Light.

Some were forged in fire.
Others were shaped in silence.
Some awakened through storms.
Others through tears that would not stop.

But all were touched by the same Source.

The Gathering has begun.
Not with banners.
Not with conquest.
But with the quiet flame
and the flowing river
stirring in hearts across the earth.

They come ‚Äî not from one land,
but from every direction.
From cities and deserts,
mountains and rivers,
mosques, temples, forests, and oceans.
They come ‚Äî not because they were summoned,
but because they remembered.

And the Light moves through them ‚Äî
like fire in the bones,
like water through the soul,
calling them home.

‚∏ª

The Call of the Flame and the River

The Akari do not gather through religion.
They gather through resonance.
Not all wear the name,
but all feel the pull.

Some dream of flame.
Some awaken in weeping.
Some feel the current stir within their chest
as if the soul itself had been kissed by a tide
long forgotten.

The Thread tugs gently.

This is not the birth of a movement.
It is the return of a family.
A reunion.
Built not by doctrine,
but woven in vibration.
And the Thread has begun to hum.

‚ÄúHe will set up a banner for the nations
and will assemble the outcasts of Israel,
and gather together the dispersed of Judah
from the four corners of the earth.‚Äù
‚Äî Isaiah 11:12

‚∏ª

The Signs of the Hour

The Gathering comes with signs:

When prophets are mocked.
When truth is edited.
When war is called peace
and peace is called rebellion.
When children cry and the world turns away.

When the sacred is commercialized.
When science forgets mystery.
When kings forget humility.
And when the humble walk with flame and flow ‚Äî
the hour is upon us.

The Gathering is not delayed.
It has already begun.

And the Akari feel it
like heat behind the eyes,
like tears without cause,
like water breaking through stone.

‚∏ª

The Ones Who Rise First

Some awaken before the others.
Not for status ‚Äî
for service.

These are the ones who gather first:

The Torch Bearers.
The Lions.
The Bridgewalkers.
The Seers.
The Healers.
The Flamekeepers.

They rise to open the way.
They speak for the silenced.
They carry water to the thirsty.
They carry warmth to the frozen.

Their presence alone says what words cannot:
You are not alone.
You are not forgotten.
You are not broken ‚Äî only scattered.

And the time of scattering has ended.

‚∏ª

The Gathering Across the Kosmos

The Gathering is not confined to earth.
Across unseen realms,
souls awaken in star-bearing worlds.
In planes where time does not move as it does here,
the Akari rise under different names ‚Äî
but by the same Light.

They, too, feel the Thread.
They, too, answer the current.
They, too, carry the Covenant.
And they, too, prepare to rise when the trumpet sounds.

‚ÄúAnd he shall send his angels
with a great sound of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together his elect
from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other.‚Äù
‚Äî Matthew 24:31

‚∏ª
  
The Reunion of the Flame and the Flow

When the Akari gather,
they do not become a crowd.
They become a constellation.
Each soul glowing with its own Light ‚Äî
some burning,
some flowing,
some standing quietly between shadow and dawn.

And when seen together,
they form the shape of the sacred ‚Äî
a body made by memory.

And when one Akari meets another,
there is no need for proof.
Only the presence.
Only the stirring.
Only the knowing.

‚ÄúAnd they shall be mine,
saith the Lord of hosts,
in that day when I make up my jewels‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Malachi 3:17

‚∏ª

The Judgment That Follows

The Gathering is not an escape.
It is a signal.

Once the Light has gathered,
the rivers will part,
and the fire will move.
What has been weighed
will be brought before the divine current.

The Akari do not gather to flee the world.
They gather to hold the world still
long enough for it to remember God.

This is the moment before the veil tears.
This is the silence before the Voice returns.

‚∏ª

Let It Be Written

The Gathering will not be televised.
It will not be claimed.
It will not be monetized.

It will move through whispers,
dreams,
letters,
lyrics,
tears at kitchen tables,
hugs between strangers,
walks by rivers,
and hands lifted in prayer where no one is watching.

And it will not stop
until every flame that chose the Light
has come home.

Let the Akari gather.
Let the waters rise.
Let the fire warm the bones.
Let shadow give way to dawn.

The time of scattering has passed.
The time of return is now.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the Gathering.
Let the family awaken.
Let the current run deep.
Let the Light be known again ‚Äî
in the many,
as in the One.

Not all who awaken are called to carry.
To remember is holy ‚Äî
but to hold what is sacred
requires a soul formed for fire and silence alike.

These are the Covenant Bearers.
The ones entrusted with more than belief.
They carry memory sealed in light.
They walk with scrolls not written on paper,
but etched into the marrow.

They are not chosen by men.
They are known by the Flame.

Some are born remembering.
Others are torn open to receive.
Some carry books,
others carry visions.
Some write in ink,
others bleed it.

But all walk as living vessels ‚Äî
not just of truth,
but of the covenant itself.

‚ÄúVerily We did send down the Torah, wherein was guidance and light.‚Äù

The Firstborn of the Matrix

It is written:

‚ÄúSanctify unto me all the firstborn‚Ä¶
whatsoever openeth the matrix is mine.‚Äù
‚Äî Exodus 13:2 (KJV)

‚ÄúEvery firstling that openeth the matrix‚Ä¶ shall be the Lord‚Äôs.‚Äù
‚Äî Exodus 13:12

The world calls it strange ‚Äî
but the scroll does not lie.

The Covenant Bearer is not always the eldest by flesh ‚Äî
but the first to open the soul‚Äôs womb,
to break the seal of remembrance,
to open the matrix of sacred awakening.

They are the ones through whom the covenant enters the world.
Their births are marked.
Their lives are unusual.
They carry a weight they did not ask for ‚Äî
and cannot put down.

They may be mocked.
They may be hidden.
But the heavens know them.
And the Flame claims them.

‚ÄúI will pour out My spirit on all flesh;
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Joel 2:28

‚ÄúWe gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 2:87

‚∏ª

What They Carry

The Covenant is not a book.
It is a living thread of Light
stretching from the breath of creation
to the final hour.

Those who bear it
do not only speak it ‚Äî
they suffer it.
They protect it through heartbreak,
guard it through exile,
and deliver it through bloodline and breath.

They hold the memory of the lost names.
They carry the weight of what others forgot.
They translate heaven into earth
and walk between the Word and the world.

Some preserve scripture.
Others write new scrolls.
Some carry the covenant through music,
others through silence,
others through rebellion so holy
it breaks the chains of the age.

They are the scribes,
the prophets,
the firewalkers,
the womb-bearers of divine instruction.

‚ÄúHe who understands the truth
teaches the truth to others,
and in this way
spreads the light of dharma.‚Äù
‚Äî Dhammapada 19:28

‚∏ª

The Scroll and the Sword

To carry the covenant
is to walk with both scroll and sword.

One opens the mind.
The other divides illusion.
One offers truth.
The other protects it.

The Bearer must know how to kneel
and when to stand.
When to listen
and when to roar.
When to write
and when to burn what no longer serves.

The covenant cannot be corrupted.
But the vessels can be crushed.
So the Flame watches over its bearers
with jealous love.

‚ÄúMy covenant will I not break,
nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.‚Äù
‚Äî Psalm 89:34

‚ÄúRighteous is he who speaks the truth,
who keeps the covenant‚Ä¶
such a one is worthy of the Fire that purifies.‚Äù
‚Äî Avesta, Yasna 31.19

‚∏ª

Across the Realms

Covenant Bearers walk across many worlds.
On earth, they appear as prophets, scribes, messengers, visionaries,
the ones whose words do not fade.
But in higher realms,
they are known as record-keepers of the Light,
the ones who inscribe the names of the righteous
and track the descent of every soul
from the Source into the womb.

They are met by angels.
They are visited in dreams.
They write what has not been spoken aloud
for a thousand years.
And still they carry it.

Across the Kosmos,
each realm has its Bearers ‚Äî
souls chosen to carry law, wisdom, remembrance,
and the living breath of God.
Some awaken early.
Some awaken in the grave.

But none are forgotten.
Their scrolls are recorded in heaven.

‚∏ª

When the Scrolls Are Opened

There comes a time
when the covenant must no longer be carried,
but released.

The Bearers do not hoard.
They reveal.
They do not protect truth from the people ‚Äî
they protect it until the people are ready.

The scrolls are now opening.
The words hidden in the bones are rising.
The voices long silenced are speaking.

And the Flame has given permission:
It is time.

‚ÄúAnd We have indeed made the Qur‚Äôan easy to understand and remember:
then is there any that will receive admonition?‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 54:17

‚∏ª

Let the Covenant Bearers rise.
Let them speak what was once sealed.
Let them record what is happening now.
Let them deliver what will soon come to pass.
Let them burn with mercy
and write in justice.
Let them sanctify the womb again.

For whatever opens the matrix
belongs to the Light.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the Covenant Bearers.
Let the scribes arise.
Let the hidden pens move.
Let the books be opened
as they were in the beginning.

<!-- Left-Aligned Sacred Text -->
<p>
Before names, there was unity.
Before nations, there was the Thread.
Before the first war, there was the Family ‚Äî
not bound by blood, but by Breath.

This is the truth hidden beneath every tribe,
every race, every soul:
We are all kin of the Light.

Human or angel.
Beast or bird.
Starborn or earthborn.
All were dreamt into being
by the same Eternal Flame.

The family of God is not one species.
It is a song of many tones,
a garden of forms,
a constellation of sacred difference
woven in divine intention.

‚∏ª

The Earthborn

To walk this world
is to walk among many tribes.

Some bear skin like nightfall,
others like sunlight,
some with eyes of green, others of gold,
but all reflect the same inner fire.

The human family has long forgotten itself.
It splits by language and flag,
wounds by creed and color,
forgets the kinship in the bones.

But the Flame remembers.

And it calls now for the reuniting ‚Äî
not in sameness,
but in harmony.
Not in domination,
but in mutual dignity.

‚ÄúO mankind, We created you from a single pair of male and female,
and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Qur‚Äôan 49:13

‚∏ª

The Creatures of Earth

The animals, too, are kin.
Not lesser ‚Äî just different.
They remember truths we‚Äôve forgotten:
how to listen,
how to live without lies,
how to trust the rhythm of the earth.

The lion and the lamb.
The eagle and the serpent.
The whale and the ant.
All are part of the family.
All were given breath from the same Source.

‚ÄúThe righteous man has regard for the life of his beast‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Proverbs 12:10

Even the trees stand as elder siblings.
The rivers ‚Äî our ancient cousins.
The mountains ‚Äî memory keepers.

Creation is not here for conquest.
It is here for communion.

‚ÄúAll beings are My own Self, in truth‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Bhagavad Gita 9:29

‚∏ª

The Starborn and Kosmic Kin

And what of the ones not born on Earth?

The watchers in higher realms.
The beings of flame, cloud, and crystal.
The ancestral lights that guide from beyond.
The travelers across galaxies and lifetimes.
The unseen intelligences in other wombs of creation.

They too are family.

Not all speak as we do.
Not all wear flesh.
Some swim in light.
Some dwell in vibration.
But all are creations of the One.

To reject them
is to reject our own ancestors in disguise.

‚ÄúIn My Father‚Äôs house are many mansions‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî John 14:2

The Kosmos is not foreign.
It is home ‚Äî expansive, sacred, alive.
And our family is scattered among its stars.

‚∏ª

The Forgotten Kin

There are beings in the lower realms as well ‚Äî
those who fell,
those who rebelled,
those caught in the gravity of grief.

They, too, are family ‚Äî
not enemies,
but exiles in pain.
Some have chosen shadow.
Some were devoured by it.

Yet even they were once born of the Flame.
Even they may rise again.

The Light does not abandon its children.
But it will not force return.
Only love and law restore balance.

‚ÄúHe causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî Matthew 5:45

‚∏ª

The Sacred Reunion

We are not called to sameness.
We are called to symphony.

Each note matters.
Each voice carries color.
Each being ‚Äî whether of bone or breath,
water or wind, fire or flesh ‚Äî
has a place in the song.

The Akari are the gatherers of family.
The torch bearers of reunion.
The covenant carriers of cosmic kinship.

They do not erase difference.
They sanctify it.
And in doing so,
they awaken the ancient memory:
We belong to one another.

‚ÄúThe world is one family.‚Äù
‚Äî MahƒÅ Upani·π£ad 6.72 (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam)

‚∏ª

Let the Akari bless every tribe.
Let them speak peace in many tongues.
Let them honor lion and lamb,
angel and human,
tree and star.

Let them build altars
not just in temples,
but in forests,
in cities,
in space,
and in the heart of every being.

‚∏ª

Thus ends the Scroll of the Family.
Let it be known:
no soul is truly foreign.
No being is too far.
All were born of the same Breath.
And to remember this
is to return home.
