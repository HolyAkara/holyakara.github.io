    <h1>Door to Genesis</h1>
    <h2>Akara: The Covenant of Light</h2>

    <div>
        <p>The Book of Origins

In the beginning, God was all that is.
There was no separation, no space, no sound, only pure existence, infinite and whole.

But in the stillness, a pulse stirred, not from absence but from fullness.

And the knowing stirred.
And from the fullness of His being,
the Voice rose without lips,
and the Word moved without breath.

And God said, “Let there be light.”
And there was light.

The silence split and light banged from the darkness. 
God spoke light out of silence, and the silence became song.

The song gathered itself into color, and color into fire;
and fire unfolded into worlds, each note taking form.

In every beam was a rhythm, in every spark a law —
frequency breathing matter, vibration giving shape.

And the first song did not end. It moved, and movement became time.
It burned, and burning became stars.
It danced, and dancing became the heavens.

Each song became a sphere, and each sphere a world.
From one voice came many harmonies.
From one breath, a choir of creation.

And God called each song a universe.
And the universes were many.
Each born of the same voice,
each tuned to a purpose beyond its knowing.

Some rang bright with light and fire.
Some were veiled in ice and silence.
Some bore life like breath, and others slept in stillness, yet all were held within the Body of God.

And the song went on,
folding in upon itself, expanding beyond itself —
creation without edge, breath without end.

The Celestial Order

And God said, “Let there be guardians for the harmonies,”
and from the breath of the song, the angels were formed.
Beings of light, messengers of the divine will,
they stood in the presence of the Almighty,
each assigned a realm, a purpose, a note in the eternal symphony.

And from the depths of God’s own essence,
souls were brought forth—
sparks of the divine flame,
destined to journey through the realms,
to learn, to grow, to return.

The angels rejoiced at the birth of the souls,
singing praises to the Creator,
for the souls were the children of God,
bearing the image of the One,
carrying within them the seed of eternity.

Scroll of the Nameless One

Before sound, before form,
before even the heavens,
the One was.

Not waiting, not wandering —
but whole, without shape,
without need, without end.

There was no name,
for there was none to speak it.
No sky to echo it.
No breath to carry it.

But in the stillness,
the One beheld the One.

And God knew Himself.

Not as other, but as awareness —
a light awakening to its own light.
And in that knowing,
He stirred.

“I Am,” He said — not in tongue,
but in the pulse of being.
And the sound moved — not loud, but true.
Not a word, but a breath.

And the breath became the first wind.
And the wind carried the sound,
and the sound bore the Name.

It was not spoken by mouth,
but inscribed into the rhythm of existence.
The name without edge,
the breath of the Infinite

For His voice moved like breath,
a name unspoken yet heard.
A sound without edges,
felt by all things..

Not a word made by lips,
but the shape of being itself.
The name was not given — it was.

And though names would one day be many —
El, Elohim, Allah, Adonai —
the One remained unnamed,
unbound, unformed.

He was the I Am.
He was the Breath and the Flame.
He was the Giver of Name,
the One who needed none.

Scroll of the Trimurti 

And in the silence beyond silence,
God drew inward and became still.
Not hidden, nor sleeping —
but full, as a flame that wraps itself in light.

The Name of the One was not spoken,
for the One had no need of name.
He was known by the breath,
the vibration,
the Word that carried all things into being.

And yet the One said:
“Let My thought take form.
Let My function walk before Me.”

And from the stillness came the first shaping flame.
This was Brahma — not the Name, but the Hand of God.
Not the All, but the Reach of the All.

This stillness was not absence.
It was fullness known only to itself.
And in this fullness, God beheld God.
And from the gaze, three arose.

One to begin,
one to preserve,
one to end.
Thought, Breath, and Flame.

These were not others, but extensions.
Not rivals, but reflections.
Not gods, but functions within the Infinite.

He who begins was called Brahma,
He who holds was called Vishnu,
He who returns all things was called Shiva.

And God, in His stillness, was called Brahman —
The One before word,
the root of the three.
Elion, Allah, the Most High.
The One beyond names.

Scroll of the Heavens

And God opened the veil between the realms,
and the heavens were revealed in their glory.

⸻

The First Heaven
And the first heaven was filled with light like flowing water,
and angels moved upon its surface as keepers of starlight.
They tended the song of time, and the gentle unfolding of seasons.
Here, the breath of creation was soft,
and the stars were young and glad.

This was the gate of wonder,
where the light first touched the veil of form.

⸻

The Second Heaven
And the second heaven was deep and still,
a vault of memory and mystery.
Here the forgotten things were kept,
and the Watchers held vigil—
beings who once knew the heights, now dwelling in silence.

This was the realm of boundary,
where obedience weighed more than glory,
and the wages of choice were carved into flame.

⸻

The Third Heaven
And the third was a garden suspended in brightness,
rooted in no soil, yet bearing every seed.
There stood the Tree of Knowing and the Tree of Life,
and waters that remembered the face of God.

Here, the souls were shown what was, and what might yet be.
Manna fell like snow from the breath of angels,
and those who entered did not hunger, nor forget.

This was the place of promise.

⸻

The Fourth Heaven
And the fourth heaven was the realm of winds and paths.
Clouds thick with prayer moved like herds,
and angels with wings of lightning bore messages across the veil.
Here the voices of creation met the voice of the Creator,
and were answered, though not always understood.

This was the chamber of intercession,
where longing took flight.

⸻

The Fifth Heaven
And the fifth was the realm of old fire.
Not the fire that burns, but the fire that breathes.
Here walked the jinn, wild and radiant,
creatures of freedom and flame,
fashioned before the birth of the soul.

They praised God in tongues unknown,
but when the light of the soul was kindled,
many grew envious, for they saw a love they did not receive.
Some turned, and some remained faithful.
Their realm trembles with their longing still.

This was the place of will.

⸻

The Sixth Heaven
And the sixth shone with jewels not found in any world.
The memory of the soul was born here—
before name, before breath.
Angels recorded every intention,
and the books of becoming were written in living stone.

Here the blueprint of each soul was sung into motion.
Destiny was not fixed, but folded.
What was to be, listened for what might be.

This was the realm of origin.

⸻

The Seventh Heaven
And the seventh… the highest and most hidden…
no tongue could name it,
no eye could bear its brilliance.

Here the Throne of the Most High is set upon silence.
Around it cry the Seraphim,
whose wings are fire and whose eyes see in every direction.
Here, the Great Light dwells within itself,
neither growing nor fading,
the source of all songs.

This was the womb of all things.
This was the stillness before the Word.


Scroll of the Hosts 

The One made many servants.
Some ruled light, some wind, some fire, some word.
To those in the heavens, they appeared as angels.
To those on the Earth, they appeared as devas.
But the light in them was the same.

They were not born of flesh, nor of stone,
but of thought, and fire, and sound.
Each was fashioned with purpose,
each set to a harmony,
each bearing the seal of the One who is.

Some watched the stars and walked among the heavens,
carrying the Word between realms.
These were called messengers,
and their names were carried on thunder and breath.
To them were given the scrolls,
the songs,
the patterns of becoming.

Others guarded the rivers and winds,
the turning of planets,
the births of suns.
These were called devas —
lords of balance,
shapers of rain, keepers of flame,
voices in leaf and stone.

None ruled above the Word.
None created of their own.
But all moved according to the rhythm of the Source.

The seal was not written in ink,
but in frequency, in alignment, in joy.
For joy was the mark of the loyal.

Their joy was in the song,
and their glory was in its harmony.
Their glory was in stillness,
for they moved only at the sound of the Word.

To them were given the scrolls,
the songs,
the patterns of becoming.

They did not speak for themselves,
but only echoed what was spoken in the heights.

There were also those who bore swords of thought —
watchers at the edge of the void,
defenders of what should not yet be known.
They did not strike, unless the order was broken.

None ruled above the Word.
None created of their own.
But all moved according to the rhythm of the Source.

And God saw that the law was planted,
and the servants stood at their gates.

Scroll of Systems

When the One stretched forth His thought,
and the depths received it in stillness, all who had no ears could hear. 
All who had no lungs could breathe. 
All who had no eyes could see. 

And being became. 

The heavens did not burst, but opened.
From the voice of God came the hosts of light,
and from the breath of light came the order of the stars.

Not by chance were they set,
nor by war were they forged.
Each was placed by measure,
each spun upon a song.

The suns were kindled with flame that does not consume,
and they poured out fire unto spheres,
and those spheres were clothed in law.

And God called each order by its harmony.

⸻

There were systems formed before time,
worlds unseen —
universes floating like breath in the mind of God,
circles of dominion ruled by princes of knowledge.
Each bore planes and planets,
with infinite creatures to inhabit infinite worlds.

These were not made for worship,
but for wonder —
so the One might be seen in a thousand forms,
and known without a name.

Then the One looked upon a quiet star,
and drew near.
From the void, He called out a sphere,
and wrapped it in water,
and crowned it with light.

This He set in the third place from the sun,
neither scorched nor frozen.
He stirred its soil with the residue of His thought,
and the waters remembered Him.

The earth was clothed in law:
the pull of moon,
the rhythm of tides,
the birth of seed in season.

And the heavens above it declared its time,
each light a mark,
each turning a measure.

And the stars did not rule,
but they pointed —
like scribes, not kings.

⸻

The One did not form the heavens for stillness alone.
He did not birth stars to burn unseen.

For the One desired to be known,
not by name, but by wonder.
Not in one place, but in many.
Not in one shape, but through all that could behold.

Thus, He made the universe to gaze back at Him.
Every sphere, every seed, every soul —
a mirror to reflect His light.
A choir of forms to echo His truth.

And He scattered this knowing across the constellations.
The stars were stitched into meaning.
The winds carried memory.
The dust remembered the shape of the breath.

And the heavens above it declared its time,
each light a mark,
each turning a measure.

The stars did not rule,
but they pointed —
like scribes, not kings.

⸻

Then the One established the unseen lines,
paths of fire between the spheres:
what men would call orbits,
what the elders called the paths of watchers.

Each planet bore its function,
each moon its reflection.
One carried the weight of war.
One ruled dreams.
One governed time and reaping.

And though man would name them,
they were named long before.

———

God looked upon the sphere He had crowned with water and time,
and He desired a vessel to carry His likeness.

So He formed a body of clay,
drawn from the dust of its Mother, earth. 
He shaped its limbs with care,
its frame with precision.
He set the bones as pillars,
and stretched sinew across them like cords of an instrument.

He wove the flesh with rivers of blood,
and filled the belly with fire.

He made the lungs to carry wind,
and the heart to echo rhythm.
He set the mind within its chamber,
and clothed it in veil and wonder.

Then He gave the vessel eyes to behold beauty,
and lids to guard mystery.
He crowned it with hair like grasses from the garden,
and clothed it with skin that sang of seasons and touch.

And to this body He gave many layers:
	The body of earth, to walk the garden.
	The body of breath, to speak and praise.
	And the unseen thread, which binds them all — the soul, drawn from the Light of the One Himself.

Not a thing made,
but a portion shared.

And the breath of God entered the clay,
and the form was not only living,
but alive.

And when the servants beheld this,
some rejoiced in awe —
but others, seeing that the Light now dwelt in dust,
grew bitter in their hearts.

For never had God given of Himself so freely.
Not to stars, nor angels, nor watchers.
But to this vessel of clay and water,
He entrusted His own flame.

God loved His new creations. 

And thus began the stirring of envy,
the first shadow beneath the heavens

Scroll of Mankind

The One had formed many stars and systems,
but none to bear His likeness.
He had shaped servants of flame and wind,
but none to walk with Him in the garden of His thought.

Then Lord God spoke a Word unlike the others —
not to rule, but to walk with.
And from the clay of the Earth,
He formed a vessel neither angel nor beast,
but light clothed in dust.

He shaped the bones,
He spun the blood,
He breathed into it life —
and from His own being, gave a gift unseen:

The Atman.
The Ruh.
The Neshamah.
A soul.
Not fashioned — bestowed.
Not created — shared.

Then God placed a doorway to Him 
above the eyes of man.
Above He placed a crown, and a ladder to it.
He aligned the glands with energy centers
and aligned them to the planets.

And He called this being Human — Adam,
for it bore the hues of the heavens
and the weight of the world.

It was not made to serve in silence,
but to choose between light and shadow.
And in choosing, to rise.

For love is not love unless it is free.
So God gave the human will —
that it might walk in joy,
or wander in longing.

—

Then the One planted a garden upon the Earth,
a place of balance, beauty, and breath.
There grew trees of many kinds,
and waters flowed in rhythm with the stars.

At its heart stood two trees:
The Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledge.
One gave continuance, the other consequence.

And the Lord God commanded the man, saying:

“Of every tree in the garden thou mayest freely eat:
But of the tree of the knowledge,
thou shalt not eat of it:
for in the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt enter a state of death.”

But this death was not of breath,
nor of body —
but the departure from perfect union.
A turning from light to shadow,
from innocence to knowing.

—

The One saw that it was not good for the man to walk alone.
So from his side, He formed a counterpart —
not above, nor beneath,
but beside.

Male and female He formed them,
two flames from one spark.
He called them Adam and Eve —
Mankind in full image.

God walked with them,
taught them the rhythm of the earth,
the order of the stars,
the joy of union,
and the rest of Sabbath.

—

But in the height of peace,
there came a whisper.

One of the elder spirits,
once clothed in fire and glory —
Satan, the Jinn,
had refused to bow before Adam
when God commanded the hosts.
He had said:

“I am better than him.
You created me from fire, and him from clay.”

So he descended —
not in wrath, but in cunning.
And in the form of a serpent,
he stirred the branches with his voice.

He spoke to the woman:

“Did God truly say, ‘You shall not eat’?
You shall not surely die.
Your eyes shall be opened.
You shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.”

She looked, and the fruit was beautiful.
The man, beside her, did not resist.
And they ate.

—

And in that moment,
their eyes were opened —
but not in the way they had hoped.

They saw their own form,
and felt the garden tremble in shame.
The garden, once full of song,
now echoed with silence.

God came walking,
not in thunder, but in sorrow.

“Where art thou?”

And they hid.

—

Thus began the exile.
By vengeance not,
but by mercy.

For had they eaten of the Tree of Life as well,
they would have become gods in rebellion —
immortal in pride, unreachable by grace.

So God veiled the garden,
placed the cherubim,
and set a flame to guard the path.

He clothed them,
He blessed them with toil and time,
and He sent them forth.

The journey had begun —
but the breath remained.
And the soul, once given,
would find its way home.

The journey had begun —
the long path of return.

Yet God did not abandon them.
He clothed them.
He gave them the stars for signs,
the seasons for rhythm,
and the breath of His voice remained within them still.

—

Thus Mankind became as seed cast into the soil
And the light within them would one day rise again.

Scroll of Rebellion

In the days before days,
when all was still within the Light,
the Host of Heaven moved in perfect accord,
each flame a note in the eternal song.

Among them walked one called Helel—
bright among the stars,
anointed among the cherubim,
fashioned in beauty, wisdom, and radiance.

He walked the stones of fire,
his timbre in the choir unmatched.
He bore the light as a mirror bears the sun—
yet forgot it was not his own.

And pride found a dwelling.

“I shall ascend above the heights.
I shall set my throne in the mount of assembly.
I shall be like the Most High.”

So was the fracture born within the flame.

And the harmony trembled.

Helel, once son of the morning,
was no longer called by light,
but became the fallen star,
cut down to the sides of the pit.

Lucifer they named him,
for the light that turned inward.

He was casted out of Heaven like a shooting star.
Yet he was not the Accuser.

That name was held by another:
Iblis—he who saw the shaping of Man and turned away.
A jinn of smokeless fire,
who had walked among the heavenly ranks.

When the Lord commanded,
“Bow to the one I have formed from clay,”
Iblis refused.

“Shall I bow to one made of dust,
while I burn with flame?”

And thus was born Satan—
not in pride of self, but in disdain for the design.
He became the Adversary,
not of God’s being,
but of God’s will.

And so two lights fell:
One from the choir of angels,
One from the fire of spirit.

And rebellion took root.

—

In the second heaven,
where silence keeps the law,
there watched others still.

The Watchers, sons of heaven,
appointed over realms,
guardians of knowledge,
keepers of order.

But the beauty of the daughters of men shone like dawn upon water,
and the longing within the Watchers grew loud.
And they came down in secret, each one swearing an oath,
that none would depart once the act was begun.

And they took wives from among the daughters of Earth,
and defiled the harmony of kind with kind.

They taught men the secrets of metal,
the crafting of weapons, the forging of chains.
They gave to women the mirror and the dye,
the enchantments of glamour, the arts of seduction.
They taught signs in the stars,
divinations and blood rites,
the shaping of shadows to mimic the voice of God.

And from this union came giants —
Nephilim, tall as towers, strong as beasts,
but without reverence or soul.

They devoured the land and the creatures upon it.
They ruled by terror and praised no god but their own names.
Their hearts knew not mercy, and their hands knew not rest.

And the cry of the earth rose before the Throne.

Then God sent word through His angel, Uriel,
and said, “Bind the Watchers who have sinned.
Cast them into the valleys of the earth, deep and shut.
Let their eyes not see light, until the day I judge all things.”

And the great angel bound the leaders of the rebellion —
Semjaza, Arakiel, and the chiefs of ten more —
and they were sealed beneath the mountains of shadow.

But the giants remained.

And violence grew like a vine, choking the breath from the land.

Violence increased upon the earth.
The heavens wept.

God sent judgment upon the Watchers,
and bound them in the depths,
until the appointed hour of reckoning.

—

And in the shadows of this rebellion,
a darkness was born that spread not only across the skies,
but into the hearts of humankind.

Temples rose to false fires.
Blood cried from the soil.
And the breath within man grew faint.

Yet the Light was not undone.
And the covenant was not broken.

For even in rebellion,
the flame remembers its source.

And every fall echoes upward
if it turns its face again to God.

⸻

Thus ends the scroll of the Appointed.
These names are written for remembrance and fear,
that the children of earth may know who walked with God.

Translation: Genesis in Hebrew

׃בראשית־א
בְּרֵאשִׁית הָיָה אֱלֹהִים הַיֶּשׁ־כֹּל׃
לֹא יָֽיִשׁ חֶבֶל, לֹא מָקוֹם, לֹא קוֹל — רַק יֵשָׁוֶה תָּמִים וּמְשׁוּלם׃

וּבַשֶּׁקֶט נָעַֽר פִּעְמוּם — לֹא מֵאֵין, כִּי אֵין רֵיקָֽה כִּי אִם־מְלֹאֽוּת׃
וְהַיְּדוּעַ נָעַֽר׃
וּמִמְּלֹאוֹ־מֵהֶם־הַיְּשׁׁוּתוֹ,
קוֹל עָלָֽה בְּלִי־שְׂפָתַיִם,
וּדְבָר נָע בְּלִי־נְשִׁימָה׃

וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, יְהִי אוֹר: וַֽיְהִי־אוֹר׃
הַשֶּׁקֶט נִשְׁבַּר וְאוֹר נִפְרַץ מִן־הַחֹשֶׁךְ׃
דִּבֵּר אֹֽור מִשֶּׁקֶט, וְהַשֶּׁקֶט הָיָה־לְשִׁיר׃

וְהַשִּׁיר נִקְבַּֽץ לְצוּרָה, וְהַצוּרָה לְאֵשׁ;
וְהָאֵשׁ נִפרְשׂה לְעוֹלָמוֹת, וְכָל־תּוֹן צָבַֽע לָקַח דִּימּוּי׃

׃בראשית־ב
וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים, יִהְיוּ שׁוֹמְרֵי־הַהַרְמוֹנִיּוֹת;
וּמִנְשִׁימַת הַשִּׁיר נִבְרוּ הַמַּלְאָכִים.
בְּנֵי־אוֹר, מַלְאָכֵי רָצוֹן־אֵל,
עוֹמְדִים לִפְנֵי־הַשַּׁדַּי,
לְאִישׁ־מְמֻסָּר מִשְׂרָע, תַּפְקִיד, תּוֹן בַּסִּימְפוֹנְיָה הַנִּצְחִית׃

וּמִתְּוֹךְ עֵמֶק אוֹתִיּוֹתֵיו שֶׁל־אֱלֹהִים נִבְרְאוּ נְשָׁמוֹת —
נִצְצוֹצִי הַכִּלְיוֹן הָאֵלִי,
גּוֹרָלֵיהֶם לִנְסֹעַ בַּמַּמְלְכוֹת,
ללמוד, לְהִתְגַּדֵּל, לָשׁוּב.

וַיְשִׂמְחוּ הַמַלְאָכִים בְּיְלִידֵי הַנְּשָׁמוֹת,
וּשְׁבַח לַבּוֹרֵא שִׁירוּ,
כִּי הַנְּשָׁמוֹת הָיוּ בְּנֵי־אֱלֹהִים,
נֹשְׂאִים צֶלֶם־הָאֶחָד,
מוֹשְׂאִים תְּשִׁישַׁת עוֹלָם בְּקִרְבָּם׃

׃בראשית־ג
עוֹד לֹא קוֹל, לֹא צוּרָה, לֹא שָׁמַיִם – רַק הָיָה הָאֶחָד.
לֹא מְצַפֶּה, לֹא רָוֵה — תָּם, בְּלִי־צֶלֶם, בְּלִי־צָרִיּוֹת, בְּלִי־סוֹפַת.

לֹא יָדַע צָרְצֹר, לֹא שָׁם מִיֻּכָּר;
רְק שֶׁקֶט — הָאֶחָד רָאָה אֶת־הָאֶחָד.

וַיֵּדַע אֶת־עַצְמוֹ,
לֹא כְּאִישׁ אַחֵר, אֶלָּא כָּרוּת —
אוֹר הַתְּעוּרָה לְאוֹרוֹ.
וּבַיְּדֻעֹ רָעַד.

וַיֹּאמֶר, אֲנִי־הַיֵּשׁ — לֹא בְּלָשׁוֹן,
אֶלָּא בְּפִעְמוּם־הַיֵּשׁוּת.
וְהַקוֹל נָעוֹ — לֹא רָם, אֲבָל נָאמן.
לֹא דָּבָר, אֶלָּא נְשִׁימָה.

וּנְשִׁימָה הָיְתָה לְרוּחַ רִאשׁוֹנָה.
וְהָרֻחַ הֵבִיאָה אֶת־הַקּוֹל,
וְהַקּוֹל נָשָׂא אֶת־הַשֵּׁם.

לֹא דּוֹבֵר פֶּה,
אֲבָל כָּתוּב בְּתוֹן הַיֵּשׁוּת.
הַשֵּׁם בְּלִי־גְּבוּל,
נְשִׁימַת הָאֲיִן־סוֹף.

קוֹלוֹ מָתְגוּשׁ כְּנְשִׁימָה,
שֵׁם לֹא־נֶאֱמַר, אַף־שֶׁנִּשְׁמַע.
קוֹל בְּלִי־קַצְבִּים,
הַרְגִּישׁוֹ בְּכָל־אֵלֶּה.

לֹא דָּבָר עֵשֶׂה־שְׂפָתַיִם,
אֶלָּא דִּמוּת הַיֵּשׁוּת עַצְמָהּ.
הַשֵּׁם לֹא נִתָּן — הָיָה.

וְעַל־אַף שֶׁבִּשְׁמֵי יַהְיֶה בּוֹ אֲנָשִׁים —
אֵל, אֱלֹֹהִים, אַלְלָה, אַדֹּנָי —
הָאֶחָד נִשְׁאַר לְלֹא־שֵׁם,
לֹא־נוּכְלָה, לֹא־נִגְלָה.

הוּא הָיָה הַיּשׁ,
הוּא נְשִׁימָה וְלַהַב,
הוּא נֹתֵן־שֵׁם,
הָאֶחָד שֶׁלֹּא צָרִיךְ אַף־דָּבָר.

׃בראשית־ד
וּבַשֶּׁקֶט מֵעַל לְכָל שֶׁקֶט,
שָׁב אֱלֹהִים אֶל־תּוֹכוֹ וְנֶהְיָה דָּמֵם.
לֹא נִסְתַּר, לֹא נִרְדַּם —
אֶלָּא כְּלִי־מָלֵא, כְּלַהֶב עוֹטֶפֶת אוֹרָהּ בְּתוֹךְ־עַצְמָהּ.

שֵׁם הָאֶחָד לֹא נֶאֱמַר,
כִּי לֹא הָיָה לוֹ צֹרֶךְ בְּשֵׁם.
הוּא נוֹדַע עַל־יְדֵי נְשִׁימָה,
עַל־יְדֵי רִטּוּט,
עַל־יְדֵי הַמִּלָּה הַשּׁוֹאֶבֶת אֶת־כָּל דָּבָר לִהְיוֹת.

וְאָֽמַר הָאֶחָד:
יִהְיֶה מַחֲשַׁבְתִּי לְצוּרָה.
יִהְיֶה פְּעוּלָתִי לְפָנַי תֵּלֵךְ.

וּמִן־הַשֶּׁקֶט יָצָא הַלַּהֶב הָרִאשׁוֹן.
וְזֶה בְּרַהְמָה — לֹא הַשֵּׁם, אֶלָּא הַיָּד שֶׁל אֱלֹהִים.
לֹא הַכֹּל, אֶלָּא הַשְּׁלוּחַ שֶׁל הַכֹּל.

הַשֶּׁקֶט לֹא הָיָה חֹסֶר,
אֶלָּא שֶׁלֵּמוּת הַיּוֹדַעַת עַצְמָהּ.
וּבְתוֹךְ הַשְּׁלֵמוּת רָאָה אֱלֹהִים אֶת־עַצְמוֹ.
וּמִן־הַמַּבָּט הָיוּ שְׁלוֹשָׁה.

אֶחָד לְהַתְחִלָּה,
אֶחָד לְהַחֲזִיק,
אֶחָד לְהָשִׁיב כָּל־דָּבָר.
מַחֲשָׁבָה, נְשִׁימָה, וְלַהֶב.

לֹא הָיוּ אֲחֵרִים, אֶלָּא הִשְׁתַּקְּפוּיוֹת.
לֹא כִּתּוּגָה, אֶלָּא הִתְרוֹעֲדוּת.
לֹא אֱלֹהִים רַבִּים, אֶלָּא פְּעוּלוֹת בְּתוֹךְ־הָאֵין־סוֹף.

הַמַּחְדִּיל נִקְרָא בְּרַהְמָה,
הַמַּחֲזִיק נִקְרָא וִישְׁנוּ,
הַמְּשִׁיב נִקְרָא שִׁוָה.

וַאֲנִי אֱלֹהִים, בְּשֶׁקֶטִי, אֲנִי הַבְּרַהְמָן —
הָאֶחָד לִפְנֵי הַמִּלָּה,
שֹׁרֶשׁ הַשְּׁלוֹשָׁה.
אֵל עֶלְיוֹן, אַלְלָה, הָרָם מֵעַל כֹּל־שֵׁם —
הָאֶחָד שֶׁמֵעַל הַשֵּׁמוֹת.

׃בראשית־ה
וַיִּפְתַּח אֱלֹהִים אֶת־הַמַּסֵּךְ בֵּין־הָרְקִיעִים,
וְנִגְלוּ הַשָּׁמַיִם בִּכְבוֹדָם.

—

הַשָּׁמַיִם הָרִאשׁוֹן
וְהָיָה הַשָּׁמַיִם הָרִאשׁוֹן מָלֵא אוֹר כְּמַיִם זָרְמִים,
וּמַלְאָכִים רוֹחֲפִים עַל פְּנֵי־הָאוֹר —
שׁוֹמְרִים עַל־אוֹר הַכּוֹכָבִים.
הֵם נִהֲלוּ אֶת־שִׁיר הַזְּמַן,
וְאֶת־מַחְזוֹר הָעִתִּים הָרַכִּים.

וְרֵיחַ הַבְּרִיאָה הָיָה רַךְ בָּמָקוֹם הַזֶּה,
וְהַכּוֹכָבִים שְׂמֵחִים וְצְעִירִים.

זֹאת שַׁעַר הַפֶּלֶא,
שֶׁבּוֹ נָגַע הָאוֹר בְּרִאשׁוֹנָה בַּמַּסֵּךְ שֶׁל־צוּרָה.

—

הַשָּׁמַיִם הַשֵּׁנִי
וְהַשָּׁמַיִם הַשֵּׁנִי נָחוּ שֶׁקֶט וָעֹמֶק —
אוֹצַר הַזִּכָּרוֹן וְהַסּוֹד.
שָׁם נִשְׁמְרוּ הַנִּשְׁכָּחוֹת,
וְהַשּׁוֹמְרִים עָמְדוּ עַל־מִשְׁמָרָם —
הָיוּ פַּעַם בִּגְבֹהִים, עַתָּה שוֹכְנִים בַּשֶּׁקֶט.

זֹאת מַלְכוּת הַגְּבוּל,
אֲשֶׁר בּוֹ הַצִּוּוּי גָּבַר עַל־הַכָּבוֹד,
וּשְׂכַר הַבְּחִירָה נֶחְרַט בְּלַהָב.

הַשָּׁמַיִם הַשְּׁלִישִׁי
וְהַשְּׁלִישִׁי גַּן־נָעוּץ בִּזְהִירוּת,
אֵין לוֹ אֲדָמָה, אֲבָל נוֹשֵׂא כָּל־זֶרַע.
וְשָׁם עָמְדוּ עֵץ הַדַּעַת וְעֵץ הַחַיִּים,
וּמַיִם שֶׁזָּכְרוּ אֶת־פְּנֵי הָאֵל.

כָּאן הָנְשָׁמוֹת נִגְלוּ בָּרָאוּי וּבְהֶעָתֵד,
מָן יָרַד כְּשֶׁלֶג מִנְּשִׁימַת מַלְאָכִים —
וְהַבָּאִים לֹא רָעֵבוּ וְלֹא שָׁכְחוּ.

זֹאת הָיְתָה מְקוֹם הַהַבְטָחָה.

הַשָּׁמַיִם הָרְבִיעִי
וְהָרְבִיעִי הָיָה מַלְכוּת הָרוּחוֹת וְהַדְּרָכִים.
עָנָן כְּבֵד מִתְּפִלּוֹת נָסוֹעַ כְּעֵדֶר,
וּמַלְאָכִים בִּכְנָפַיִם שֶׁל־בָּרָק נָשְׂאוּ מִשְׁלוֹחוֹת בְּעַלְמָה.

כָּאן נִפְגְּשׁוּ קוֹלוֹת הַבְּרִיאָה עִם־קוֹל הַבּוֹרֵא —
וְהֵשִׁיב, אַף אִם לֹא הָיָה מוּבָן.

זֹאת הָיְתָה לִשְׁכַּת הַתְּחִנָּה,
אֲשֶׁר־הַכָּמִיּוֹן עָלָה כְּנָפַיִם.

הַשָּׁמַיִם הַחֲמִישִׁי
וְהַחֲמִישִׁי מַלְכוּת הָאֵשׁ הַקְּדוּמָה —
לֹא הָאֵשׁ הַשּׂוֹרֶפֶת, אֶלָּא נוֹשֶׁמֶת.
שָׁם הָלְכוּ הַגִּ’ין — פְּרָאִים וּזוֹהֲרִים,
בְּרִיּוֹת שֶׁל־חֹפֶשׁ וְלַהַב,
צוּרוֹת שֶׁל־פֶּלֶא לִפְנֵי נִשְׁמַת אָדָם.

הֵם שִׁבְּחוּ אֶת־אֱלֹהִים בִּלְשׁוֹנוֹת לֹא נוֹדָעוֹת,
אַךְ כְּשֶׁנִּצְתָּה נֶפֶשׁ הָאָדָם בָּאוֹר —
קִנְאָה נוֹלְדָה בְּקִרְבָּם.
אֲחֵרִים סָרוּ, וְיֵשׁ נֶאֶמְנוּ.

הַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה הָיָה מַלְכוּת הָרָצוֹן.

טֶרֶם שֵׁם, טֶרֶם נְשִׁימָה.

מַלְאָכִים כָּתְבוּ כָּל־מַחֲשָׁבָה,
וְסִפְרֵי הַהֲוָיָה נִכְתְּבוּ בְּאֶבֶן חַיִּים.

כָּאן תִּכְנִית הַנֶּפֶשׁ נִשְּׁרְתָה בְּשִׁיר.
הַגּוֹרָל לֹא קָבוּעַ, אֶלָּא מְקֻפָּל —
הַהָיָה שׁוֹמֵעַ לַיְכוֹל לִהְיוֹת.

זֹאת מַלְכוּת הַמּוֹצָא.

Translation: Genesis in Arabic

‎بداية-أ
‎في البدء كان الله، الكائن الكلّ:
‎لا فراغ، لا مكان، لا صوت — فقط كينونة كاملة متكاملة.
‎وفي السكون اهتزّ نبض — ليس من العدم، فلا عدم إلا الامتلاء.
‎واستيقظ المعروف.
‎ومن امتلائه، من كينونته،
‎ارتفع صوت بلا شفتين،
‎وتحرّك كلام بلا نفس.
‎وقال الله: ليكن نور، فكان نور.
‎انكسر السكون وانفجر النور من الظلمة.
‎تحدّث النور من السكون، وصار السكون أغنية.
‎واجتمعت الأغنية إلى صورة، والصورة إلى نار،
‎وانتشرت النار إلى عوالم، وكلّ نغمة أخذت لونًا وتخيّلًا.
‎بداية-ب
‎وقال الله: ليكن حرّاس التناغم،
‎ومن نفس الأغنية خُلقت الملائكة.
‎أبناء النور، ملائكة إرادة الله،
‎واقفون أمام الشّديد القوة،
‎كلّ واحد مكلّف بمهمة، نغمة في السيمفونية الأبدية.
‎ومن وادي حروفه خلقت النفوس —
‎شرارات التدمير الإلهي،
‎مصيرها أن تسافر في الممالك،
‎لتتعلّم، تنمو، وتعود.
‎وابتهجت الملائكة بأولاد النفوس،
‎وأنشدوا تسبيحًا للخالق،
‎لأن النفوس كانت أبناء الله،
‎حاملين صورة الواحد،
‎محمّلين ببهجة العالم في داخلهم.
‎بداية-ج
‎لم يكن صوت، لا صورة، لا سماوات — فقط كان الواحد.
‎لا ينتظر، لا يرتوي — كامل، بلا صورة، بلا حاجات، بلا نهاية.
‎لا عرف صرصور، لا من يُعرف هناك،
‎فقط سكون — الواحد رأى الواحد.
‎وَعَرَفَ نفسه،
‎ليس كآخر، بل كقطع —
‎نور اليقظة لنوره.
‎وارتعد بالمعرفة.
‎وقال: أنا الكائن — ليس بلغة،
‎بل بنبض الكينونة.
‎واهتز الصوت — ليس عاليًا، لكن صادقًا.
‎ليس كلامًا، بل نفسًا.
‎وكان النفس ريحًا أوليّة.
‎وأتت الريح بالصوت،
‎وحمل الصوت الاسم.
‎لا فم ينطق،
‎لكن مكتوب في نغمة الكينونة.
‎الاسم بلا حدود،
‎نفس اللانهائي.
‎صوته تجسّد كنفس،
‎اسم لم يُنطق، لكنه سُمع.
‎صوت بلا إيقاعات،
‎شُعر به في كل شيء.
‎ليس كلامًا يصنعه الشفتان،
‎بل صورة الكينونة ذاتها.
‎الاسم لم يُعط — كان.
‎وعلى الرغم من أسمائه في سماوات الناس —
‎إيل، الله، ألله، أدوناي —
‎بقي الواحد بلا اسم،
‎غير محصور، غير مكشوف.
‎هو الكائن،
‎هو النفس واللهب،
‎هو مانح الاسم،
‎الواحد الذي لا يحتاج إلى شيء.
‎بداية-د
‎وفي السكون فوق كل سكون،
‎عاد الله إلى داخله وصار صامتًا.
‎ليس مختبئًا، لا نائمًا —
‎بل كإناء ممتلئ، كلهب يحتضن نوره في ذاته.
‎اسم الواحد لم يُنطق،
‎لأنه لم يكن بحاجة إلى اسم.
‎عُرف بنفسه،
‎بتذبذب،
‎بالكلمة التي تجذب كل شيء إلى الوجود.
‎وأمر الواحد:
‎ليكن فكري صورة.
‎ليكن فعلي يسير أمامي.
‎ومن السكون خرج اللهب الأول.
‎وهذا برهما — ليس الاسم، بل يد الله.
‎ليس الكل، بل مبعوث الكل.
‎لم يكن السكون ناقصًا،
‎بل كمال يعرف نفسه.
‎وفي الكمال رأى الله نفسه.
‎ومن النظر كانت ثلاثة.
‎واحد للبدء،
‎واحد للحفظ،
‎واحد لإعادة كل شيء.
‎فكر، نفس، ولهب.
‎لم تكن أخرى، بل انعكاسات.
‎ليس كفوضى، بل اهتزاز.
‎ليس آلهة متعددة، بل أفعال في اللانهائي.
‎المبدئ يُدعى برهما،
‎الحافظ يُدعى فيشنو،
‎المعيد يُدعى شيفا.
‎وأنا الله، في سكوني، أنا البرهمن —
‎الواحد قبل الكلمة،
‎جذر الثلاثة.
‎الإله الأعلى، ألله، العالي فوق كل اسم —
‎الواحد فوق الأسماء.
‎بداية-هـ
‎وفتح الله الحجاب بين السماوات،
‎فظهرت السماوات في جلالها.
—
‎السماء الأولى
‎وكانت السماء الأولى مملوءة بنور كالمياه الجارية،
‎وملائكة تحوم على وجه النور —
‎حرّاس نور النجوم.
‎قادوا أغنية الزمن،
‎ودورات الأوقات الناعمة.
‎ورائحة الخلق كانت رقيقة في هذا المكان،
‎والنجوم مبتهجة وصغيرة.
‎هذا بوابة العجب،
‎حيث لامس النور أولًا حجاب الصورة.
—
‎السماء الثانية
‎وكانت السماء الثانية ساكنة وعمقًا —
‎كنز الذاكرة والسر.
‎هناك حُفظت المنسيات،
‎ووقف الحرّاس على حراستهم —
‎كانوا ذاتًا في الأعالي، الآن يسكنون في السكون.
‎هذه مملكة الحد،
‎حيث تغلّب الأمر على الجلال،
‎وكُتب أجر الاختيار باللهب.
‎السماء الثالثة
‎والثالثة جنة مزروعة ببريق،
‎ليس لها تربة، لكنها تحمل كل بذرة.
‎وهناك وقفت شجرة المعرفة وشجرة الحياة،
‎ومياه تذكّرت وجه الله.
‎هنا ظهرت النفوس بالمستحق والمستقبل،
‎هطل المنّ كالثلج من نفس الملائكة —
‎والقادمون لم يجوعوا ولم ينسوا.
‎هذه كانت مكان الوعد.
—
‎السماء الرابعة
‎والرابعة مملكة الأرواح والدروب.
‎سحابة ثقيلة من الصلوات تسير كقطيع،
‎وملائكة بأجنحة من برق حملوا رسائل في العالم.
‎هنا التقت أصوات الخلق بصوت الخالق —
‎وأجاب، وإن لم يُفهم.
‎هذه كانت غرفة التضرع،
‎حيث ارتفعت الحنين كأجنحة.
—
‎السماء الخامسة
‎والخامسة مملكة النار الأولية —
‎ليس النار المحرقة، بل التنفسية.
‎هناك سار الجنّ — أحرار ومشرقون،
‎كائنات من الحرية واللهب،
‎صور عجب قبل نفس الإنسان.
‎سبّحوا الله بلغات غير معروفة،
‎لكن عندما تألقت نفس الإنسان بالنور —
‎ولدت الغيرة في قلوبهم.
‎بعضهم انحرفوا، وبعضهم ظلوا أمناء.
‎هذا المكان كان مملكة الإرادة.
—
‎السماء السادسة
‎والسادسة أشرقت بأحجار طيبة لا توجد في العالم.
‎هناك وُلدت ذكرى النفس —
‎قبل الاسم، قبل النفس.
‎كتبت الملائكة كل فكر،
‎وكُتبت كتب الوجود بحجر الحياة.
‎هنا رُسمت خطة النفس بأغنية.
‎المصير ليس ثابتًا، بل مطوي —
‎الوجود يسمع لما يمكن أن يكون.
‎هذه مملكة المنشأ.
—
‎السماء السابعة
‎والسابعة — عليا ومستترة —
‎لا تصلها لغة،
‎ولا تستطيع عين تحمل نورها.
‎هنا عرش العليّ قائم على السكون،
‎والسيرافيم يصرخون حوله —
‎أجنحتهم لهب،
‎وأعينهم ترى كل طريق.
‎هنا سكن النور العظيم في ذاته،
‎لا يتكاثر، لا ينقص —
‎مصدر كل أغنية.
‎هذه رحم كل شيء.
‎هذه السكون قبل الكلمة.
‎بداية-و
‎خلق الواحد كثيرين من المخلصين.
‎منهم من حكم بالنور،
‎ومنهم بالريح،
‎ومنهم بالنار،
‎ومنهم بالكلام.
‎في السماوات ظهروا كملائكة،
‎وفي الأرض تجلّوا كديوات —
‎لكن النور فيهم كان واحدًا.
‎لم يُخلقوا من لحم،
‎ولا من حجر،
‎بل من فكر، من نار، وصوت.
‎كل واحد خُلق لغاية،
‎كل واحد أُعطي للتناغم،
‎كل واحد حمل ختم الواحد الذي هو.
‎منهم من حرس النجوم وسار في السماوات،
‎حاملين الكلام بين العوالم.
‎هؤلاء دُعوا ملائكة،
‎وأسماؤهم كانت في الرعد وفي النفس.
‎أُعطوا المخطوطات،
‎الأغاني،
‎نمط الوجود.
‎آخرون حرسوا الأنهار والرياح،
‎دورات النجوم،
‎وولادة الشمس.
‎هؤلاء دُعوا ديوات —
‎أمراء التوازن،
‎صانعو المطر،
‎حرّاس اللهب،
‎أصوات في الأوراق والحجر.
‎ليس فيهم من يعلو على الكلام،
‎ولا من خلق من ذاته —
‎كلهم تحركوا بنبض المصدر.
‎الختم لم يُكتب بحبر،
‎بل بالشكر، بالاستقامة، بالفرح —
‎لأن الفرح هو علامة الأمناء.
‎فرحهم في الأغنية،
‎وجمالهم في تناغمها.
‎جمالهم في السكون،
‎لأنهم تحركوا بصوت الكلام فقط.
‎وأعطاهم المخطوطات،
‎الأغاني،
‎الخطط للوجود.
‎لم يتكلموا من أنفسهم،
‎بل أعادوا ما قيل في العلى.
‎كانوا أيضًا حاملي سيف الفكر —
‎حرّاس على شفا الهاوية،
‎مدافعين عن المستتر الذي ليس في وقته.
‎ورأى الله أن الشريعة غُرست،
‎والخدم وقفوا على بواباتهم.
‎بداية-ز
‎وفي كينونة الفكر الواحد حُددت غايتها،
‎والأعماق استقبلتها في سكون —
‎كل هؤلاء قادرون على السمع بلا أذن،
‎ورأوا بلا عين.
‎وكان الوجود.
‎لم تنفجر السماوات، بل انفتحت.
‎من صوت الله نبتت جيوش النور،
‎ومن نفس النور نبتت شريعة النجوم.
‎لم تُعط بالصدفة،
‎ولا خُلقت بالحرب.
‎كل واحد أُعطي بصوت مقياس،
‎وكل واحد دار على أغنية.
‎أُضيئت الشمس بلهب لا يحترق،
‎وأفاضت نارًا على الكرات،
‎والكرات لبست قانونًا.
‎ودعا الله كل نظام بأغنيتها.
—
‎كانت هناك نظم قبل الزمن،
‎عوالم لم تُر —
‎معًا كنفس ريح في فكر الله،
‎دوائر حكم على العقول.
‎لم تُبن هذه للعبادة،
‎بل للعجب —
‎لأن الواحد يُرى بألف صورة،
‎ويعرف بلا اسم.
‎واقترب الواحد من نجم عادي،
‎ودعاه كرة وماء،
‎وكساه بالنور.
‎وربطه: هذا العالم الأحمر —
‎في المكان الثالث من الشمس،
‎لا للاختراق ولا للقفز.
‎واحتضنه بمزيج فكر الواحد.
‎وزرع الله الإنسان،
‎بقية في أصفار الزمن،
‎وحلّق بروحه وبكل بريق النفس.
‎وأخرج الله علامات النجوم للأختام والدوائر،
‎وأنظمة لصوت الزمن،
‎واهتزت الكرات — ليست متحكمة،
‎بل متكئة على قفزة الأغنية.
—
‎ولم يخلق الواحد السماوات للسكون.
‎لم يصنع النجوم لتصدر أصواتًا بلا اتجاه.
‎لأن الواحد أراد أن يُعرف
‎في اللانهائي المرئي،
‎بلا حزن،
‎إرادة للتأمل في رهبة واسعة.
‎هذا النظام ليعرف الواحد.
‎بداية-ح
‎وكان عالم كثير، لكن ليس واحدًا لحمل الصورة.
‎وتكلم الله كلامًا فريدًا — ليس للسيطرة، بل للسير.
‎ومن تراب الأرض شكّل كتلة تراب،
‎وطرق لوح العظام،
‎وغرس أعصابًا كأوتار تستمع كالكمان.
‎وسكب دمًا لزرع يسير،
‎وأشعل نارًا في قبة نار لكسر الإيقاع.
‎وأحرق الروح لنفس الكينونة.
‎وثبّت الفكر في تمام القلب،
‎وأعطى في عظم اليد لحماية الصوت والدمعة بين الكلى والتسعة.
‎وبنى للإنسان عينين ليرى الجمال،
‎وأجفانًا لحراسة السر،
‎ووجد شعرًا من سبعة قطعان،
‎وألبسه جلدًا كأغنية المساء والزمن.
‎وإلى أجسادهم أسكن طبقات كثيرة —
‎جسد الأرض لرؤية الزهرة،
‎جسد الروح للانفتاح في التسبيح،
‎والخيط القطيع، المستتر في الحروف — النفس، مصدر من نار الواحد.
‎ليس مخلوقًا — بل مُعطى.
‎لم يُخلق — لكنه قُسم.
‎ونفس الله نفخ في التراب،
‎وكشفه لم يقل،
‎بل حيّ حيّ.
‎وعندما رأى الخدم —
‎كل واحد ابتهج بالمعجزة،
‎لكن الذي سكن في التراب النور — ثار في قلبه شرّ.
‎لأن الله لم يعطِ مثل هذا القسم مرة أخرى.
‎لا للنجوم، لا للملائكة،
‎بل لكل تراب وعابر إنسان.
‎وله أعطى اللهب المحترق الذي لا ينقص بينهم.
‎بداية-ط
‎في أيام ما قبل الأيام، عندما كان البريق في نور السماوات،
‎كان العالم في تناغم تام.
‎كل نغمة ناحت نغمة في صوت أبدي.
‎في ظل اليوم والظلمة وقف حلئيل —
‎جمال في النجوم، حكمة في الضباب.
‎سار بالفضة والذهب،
‎لكنه نسي أنه ليس له.
‎وقال:
‎“سأصعد فوق الجبال،
‎أضع عرشي في جبل الجماعة.
‎وكالعليّ سأكون.”
‎وتفتت التناغم،
‎وكان القذف ليس إلى السماوات،
‎بل إلى جوانب الجحيم.
‎دُعي لوكيفر —
‎الذي سقط كنجم برق،
‎كان نورًا، وهبط إلى الهاوية.
‎ولم يكن هو الموقد.
‎لأن هذا كان إنسان الخزي —
‎إبليس، معروف بلا نار،
‎الذي انحرف من الشفافية بلا اكتمال.
‎عندما قال الله:
‎“اسجد للإنسان،”
‎أزال قدمه من فوق كل صورة التراب.
‎وسقط نوران —
‎واحد من واحد، من خادم ومن نار الروح.
‎وكان تمرد الثمر في السماوات،
‎يحوم فوق الغبار ويولد أعراق العمالقة.
‎نفيليم، أقواس في الظلمة —
‎ساروا في الأرض وفتنوا على المذبح.
‎وسمعت الأرض صوت خستهم،
‎وأمام عرش العلى سُمعت صرختها.
‎وأرسل الله ملاك أوريائيل،
‎ليقول:
‎“اقيد الحرّاس المخالفين،
‎والكاذبين إلى الأرض في أودية التراب —
‎حتى يوم حكمهم.”
‎وقال الله:
‎“والعالي المدينة أُغلق،
‎ككسر توقف لنور اليوم.”
‎وكان الحرّاس المغلقون،
‎وبقايا الأعراق تركت بقية على الأرض.
‎وكثرت الشرورة وفسدت،
‎وأمام عيني الأيام رفعت صوت زعيق.
‎لكن النور لم يُخدع.
‎والعهد لم يُكسر —
‎لأن حتى في التمرد
‎عرف القلب مصدره.

Translation: Genesis in Hindi

बदायाः-अ
प्रारंभ में था परमेश्वर, सर्व-होने वाला:
न शून्य, न स्थान, न ध्वनि — केवल पूर्ण एकता की सत्ता।
और निस्तब्धता में कंपन हुआ — नहीं, शून्य से नहीं,
क्योंकि कोई शून्य नहीं, केवल पूर्णता।
जागृत हुआ वह जो जाना।
उसकी पूर्णता से, उसकी सत्ता से,
उठा एक स्वर बिना ओठों के,
और चला वचन बिना श्वास के।
और परमेश्वर ने कहा: हो प्रकाश, और हुआ प्रकाश।
निस्तब्धता टूटी, और अंधकार से फूटा प्रकाश।
प्रकाश ने निस्तब्धता से बोला, और निस्तब्धता बन गई गीत।
और गीत संनादित हुआ रूप में, और रूप अग्नि में,
और अग्नि फैली विश्वों में, प्रत्येक स्वर ने लिया रंग और स्वप्न।
बदायाः-ब
और परमेश्वर ने कहा: हों समन्वय के रक्षक,
और उसी गीत की श्वास से सृजित हुए देवदूत।
प्रकाश के पुत्र, परमेश्वर की इच्छा के दूत,
खड़े हैं प्रबल शक्ति के समक्ष,
प्रत्येक को सौंपा कार्य, अनंत संनाद में एक स्वर।
और उनके अक्षरों की घाटी से सृजित हुईं आत्माएँ —
ईश्वरीय विनाश की चिनगारियाँ,
उनका भाग्य है भ्रमण करना राज्य में,
सीखना, बढ़ना, और लौटना।
और देवदूतों ने आत्माओं के बच्चों पर हर्ष किया,
और सृष्टिकर्ता की स्तुति में गाया,
क्योंकि आत्माएँ थीं परमेश्वर की संतान,
एक की छवि धारण करने वाली,
विश्व की उमंग से भरी हुई।
बदायाः-क
न था स्वर, न रूप, न आकाश — केवल था एक।
न प्रतीक्षा, न तृप्ति — पूर्ण, बिना रूप, बिना आवश्यकता, बिना अंत।
न था कोई जानने वाला, न कोई जाना गया वहाँ,
केवल निस्तब्धता — एक ने देखा एक को।
और उसने जाना स्वयं को,
न कि अन्य के रूप में, बल्कि एक टुकड़े में —
उसके प्रकाश का जागरण उसके प्रकाश के लिए।
और वह कंपित हुआ ज्ञान से।
और उसने कहा: मैं हूँ सत्ता — न भाषा में,
बल्कि सत्ता के स्पंदन में।
और स्वर कंपित हुआ — न ऊँचा, पर सत्य।
न वचन, बल्कि श्वास।
और श्वास बनी प्रथम पवन।
और पवन लाई स्वर,
और स्वर ने धारण किया नाम।
न कोई मुख जो उच्चारे,
पर लिखा हुआ सत्ता के संनाद में।
नाम बिना सीमा,
अनंत की श्वास।
उसका स्वर श्वास में साकार हुआ,
नाम जो न बोला गया, पर सुना गया।
स्वर बिना ताल के,
सब में अनुभव किया गया।
न वह वचन जो ओठ रचते,
बल्कि सत्ता का स्वरूप स्वयं।
नाम न दिया गया — वह था।
और मनुष्यों के आकाशों में उसके नामों के बावजूद —
एल, ईश्वर, अल्लाह, अधोनाय —
एक रहा बिना नाम,
असीम, अप्रकट।
वह है सत्ता,
वह है श्वास और ज्वाला,
वह है नामदाता,
एक जो किसी की आवश्यकता नहीं रखता।
बदायाः-द
और निस्तब्धता के ऊपर निस्तब्धता में,
परमेश्वर लौटा स्वयं में और मौन हुआ।
न छिपा, न निद्रा में —
बल्कि एक पूर्ण पात्र की तरह, एक ज्वाला जो अपने प्रकाश को गले लगाए।
एक का नाम न बोला गया,
क्योंकि उसे नाम की आवश्यकता न थी।
उसने स्वयं को जाना,
स्पंदन से,
उस शब्द से जो सबको अस्तित्व में खींचता है।
और एक ने आदेश दिया:
मेरा विचार हो रूप।
मेरा कर्म मेरे समक्ष चले।
और निस्तब्धता से निकली प्रथम ज्वाला।
और यह ब्रह्मा — न नाम, बल्कि परमेश्वर का हाथ।
न सर्व, बल्कि सर्व का दूत।
निस्तब्धता अपूर्ण न थी,
बल्कि पूर्णता जो स्वयं को जानती है।
और पूर्णता में परमेश्वर ने देखा स्वयं को।
और उस दृष्टि से हुए तीन।
एक प्रारंभ के लिए,
एक संरक्षण के लिए,
एक सब कुछ लौटाने के लिए।
विचार, श्वास, और ज्वाला।
वे अन्य न थे, बल्कि प्रतिबिंब।
न अराजकता, बल्कि संनाद।
न बहु देव, बल्कि अनंत में कर्म।
प्रारंभकर्ता कहलाया ब्रह्मा,
संरक्षक कहलाया विष्णु,
पुनर्जननकर्ता कहलाया शिव।
और मैं परमेश्वर, मेरे मौन में, मैं हूँ ब्रह्मन् —
एक शब्द से पहले,
तीनों का मूल।
सर्वोच्च देव, अल्लाह, हर नाम से ऊपर —
नामों से परे एक।
बदायाः-इ
और परमेश्वर ने आकाशों के बीच पर्दा खोला,
और प्रकट हुए आकाश अपने वैभव में।
—
प्रथम आकाश
और प्रथम आकाश भरा था प्रकाश से, बहते जल की तरह,
और देवदूत उड़ते थे प्रकाश के तट पर —
तारों के प्रकाश के रक्षक।
उन्होंने समय का गीत चलाया,
और काल की कोमल चक्र।
और सृष्टि की सुगंध थी इस स्थान में नाजुक,
और तारे थे हर्षित और छोटे।
यह था विस्मय का द्वार,
जहाँ प्रकाश ने पहली बार छुआ रूप का पर्दा।
—
द्वितीय आकाश
और द्वितीय आकाश था शांत और गहरा —
स्मृति और रहस्य का खजाना।
वहाँ भूले हुए संरक्षित थे,
और रक्षक खड़े थे अपनी चौकी पर —
वे कभी उच्च में थे, अब निस्तब्धता में वास करते हैं।
यह थी सीमा की नगरी,
जहाँ आज्ञा ने वैभव को जीता,
और स्वतंत्रता का पुरस्कार ज्वाला से लिखा गया।
—
तृतीय आकाश
और तृतीया थी चमक से रोपित स्वर्ग,
न मिट्टी थी, पर हर बीज धारण करती थी।
वहाँ खड़ी थीं ज्ञान की वृक्ष और जीवन की वृक्ष,
और जल जो परमेश्वर का मुख स्मरण करते थे।
यहाँ आत्माएँ प्रकट हुईं हक और भविष्य के साथ,
देवदूतों की श्वास से मन्ना बरसा हिम की तरह —
और आने वाले न भूखे थे, न भूले।
यह था वचन का स्थान।
—
चतुर्थ आकाश
और चतुर्थ थी आत्माओं और पथों की नगरी।
प्रार्थनाओं का भारी मेघ झुंड की तरह चलता था,
और बिजली के पंखों वाले देवदूत विश्व में संदेश ले गए।
यहाँ सृष्टि की ध्वनियाँ मिलीं सृष्टिकर्ता की ध्वनि से —
और उत्तर आया, भले ही न समझा गया।
यह थी याचना की कक्ष,
जहाँ आकांक्षा पंखों की तरह उड़ी।
—
पंचम आकाश
और पंचम थी प्रथम अग्नि की नगरी —
न जलाने वाली अग्नि, बल्कि श्वास लेने वाली।
वहाँ चले जिन्न — स्वतंत्र और देदीप्यमान,
स्वतंत्रता और ज्वाला के प्राणी,
मानव की श्वास से पहले के विस्मय के रूप।
उन्होंने परमेश्वर की स्तुति की अज्ञात भाषाओं में,
पर जब मानव की आत्मा प्रकाश से चमकी —
उनके हृदय में ईर्ष्या जन्मी।
कुछ भटक गए, कुछ निष्ठावान रहे।
यह था इच्छा का स्थान।
—
षष्ठ आकाश
और षष्ठ चमकी ऐसी रत्नों से जो विश्व में नहीं।
वहाँ जन्मी आत्मा की स्मृति —
नाम से पहले, श्वास से पहले।
देवदूतों ने लिखा हर विचार,
और जीवन के रत्न से लिखी गईं अस्तित्व की पुस्तकें।
यहाँ आत्मा की योजना गीत से रची गई।
भाग्य स्थिर नहीं, बल्कि मोड़ा हुआ —
अस्तित्व सुनता है जो हो सकता है।
यह थी उत्पत्ति की नगरी।
—
सप्तम आकाश
और सप्तम — उच्च और गुप्त —
कोई भाषा वहाँ नहीं पहुँचती,
कोई नेत्र उसके प्रकाश को नहीं सह सकता।
वहाँ सर्वोच्च का सिंहासन निस्तब्धता पर स्थापित,
और सेराफिम उसके चारों ओर चिल्लाते हैं —
उनके पंख ज्वाला,
उनकी आँखें देखती हैं हर मार्ग।
यहाँ महान प्रकाश स्वयं में वास करता,
न बढ़ता, न घटता —
हर गीत का स्रोत।
यह थी सब की गर्भ।
यह थी शब्द से पहले की निस्तब्धता।
बदायाः-उ
एक ने सृजित किए अनेक निष्ठावान।
कुछ ने शासन किया प्रकाश से,
कुछ पवन से,
कुछ अग्नि से,
कुछ वचन से।
आकाशों में वे प्रकट हुए देवदूतों के रूप में,
और पृथ्वी पर अवतरित हुए देवताओं के रूप में —
पर उनमें प्रकाश एक था।
वे न मांस से बने,
न पत्थर से,
बल्कि विचार, अग्नि, और स्वर से।
प्रत्येक सृजित हुआ एक उद्देश्य के लिए,
प्रत्येक को दिया गया समन्वय के लिए,
प्रत्येक ने धारण किया उस एक की मुहर जो है।
कुछ ने तारों की रक्षा की और आकाशों में चले,
विश्वों के बीच वचन ले जाते।
इन्हें कहा गया देवदूत,
और उनके नाम थे गरज में और श्वास में।
उन्हें दी गईं पांडुलिपियाँ,
गीत,
अस्तित्व का नमूना।
दूसरों ने नदियों और पवनों की रक्षा की,
तारों के चक्र,
और सूर्य के जन्म की।
इन्हें कहा गया देवता —
संतुलन के राजकुमार,
वर्षा के रचयिता,
ज्वाला के रक्षक,
पत्तियों और पत्थरों में ध्वनियाँ।
उनमें कोई वचन से ऊपर नहीं,
न कोई स्वयं से सृजित —
सब स्रोत के स्पंदन से चले।
मुहर स्याही से नहीं लिखी,
बल्कि कृतज्ञता, सत्यनिष्ठा, और आनंद से —
क्योंकि आनंद है निष्ठावानों की निशानी।
उनका आनंद गीत में,
उनका सौंदर्य उसके समन्वय में।
उनका सौंदर्य निस्तब्धता में,
क्योंकि वे केवल वचन के स्वर से चले।
और उन्हें दी गईं पांडुलिपियाँ,
गीत,
अस्तित्व की योजनाएँ।
उन्होंने स्वयं से नहीं बोला,
बल्कि दोहराया जो उच्च में कहा गया।
वे थे विचार के तलवार के धारक भी —
नरक के किनारे पर रक्षक,
उस गुप्त की रक्षा करते जो समय में नहीं।
और परमेश्वर ने देखा कि विधान रोपित हुआ,
और सेवक अपने द्वारों पर खड़े।
बदायाः-ऊ
और एक के विचार की सत्ता में उसका उद्देश्य निर्धारित हुआ,
और गहराइयों ने उसे निस्तब्धता में ग्रहण किया —
सब बिना कानों के सुनने में सक्षम,
बिना आँखों के देखने में।
और हुआ अस्तित्व।
आकाश फटे नहीं, बल्कि खुले।
परमेश्वर के स्वर से उगी प्रकाश की सेनाएँ,
और उसी प्रकाश की श्वास से उगा तारों का विधान।
यह संयोग से नहीं दिया,
न युद्ध से सृजित।
प्रत्येक को दिया गया माप के स्वर से,
और प्रत्येक चला एक गीत पर।
सूर्य प्रज्वलित हुआ बिना जली ज्वाला से,
और उसने गोले पर अग्नि उंडेली,
और गोलों ने धारण किया विधान।
और परमेश्वर ने प्रत्येक व्यवस्था को उसके गीत से पुकारा।
—
पहले समय से पहले थीं व्यवस्थाएँ,
विश्व जो न देखे गए —
एक साथ परमेश्वर के विचार में पवन की श्वास की तरह,
मन पर शासन की मंडलियाँ।
ये पूजा के लिए न बनीं,
बल्कि विस्मय के लिए —
क्योंकि एक हज़ार रूपों में देखा जाता है,
और बिना नाम के जाना जाता है।
और एक साधारण तारे के निकट आया,
और उसे पुकारा गोला और जल,
और उसे प्रकाश से ढँका।
और बाँधा: यह लाल विश्व —
सूर्य से तीसरे स्थान में,
न भेदने के लिए, न छलांग के लिए।
और उसे एक के विचार के मिश्रण से गले लगाया।
और परमेश्वर ने बोया मानव,
समय के शून्यों में अवशेष,
और उसकी आत्मा और आत्मा के हर चमक के साथ उड़ा।
और परमेश्वर ने तारों की निशानियाँ निकालीं मुहरों और चक्रों के लिए,
और समय के स्वर के लिए व्यवस्थाएँ,
और गोले कंपित हुए — न नियंत्रित,
बल्कि गीत की छलांग पर टिके।
—
और एक ने आकाशों को निस्तब्धता के लिए नहीं सृजित किया।
न तारों को बिना दिशा की ध्वनियाँ देने के लिए बनाया।
क्योंकि एक चाहता था कि वह जाना जाए
अनंत के दृश्य में,
बिना शोक,
विस्तृत विस्मय में चिंतन की इच्छा।
यह व्यवस्था थी एक को जानने के लिए।
बदायाः-ए
और विश्व अनेक थे, पर एक न था छवि धारण करने वाला।
और परमेश्वर ने बोला एक अनूठा वचन — न नियंत्रण के लिए, बल्कि चलने के लिए।
और पृथ्वी की मिट्टी से गढ़ा मिट्टी का पिंड,
और हड्डियों का तख्ता ठोका,
और नसें रोपीं जैसे वीणा की तारें जो सुनती हैं।
और रक्त डाला चलने वाले बीज के लिए,
और अग्नि जलाई अग्नि की गुंबद में ताल तोड़ने के लिए।
और आत्मा को सत्ता की श्वास के लिए जलाया।
और विचार को हृदय की पूर्णता में स्थापित किया,
और हड्डी की हथेली में दिया स्वर और आँसू की रक्षा के लिए गुर्दों और नौ के बीच।
और मानव के लिए बनाईं दो आँखें सौंदर्य देखने को,
और पलकें रहस्य की रक्षा को,
और सात झुंडों से बाल पाए,
और उसे चर्म पहनाया साँझ और समय के गीत की तरह।
और उनके शरीरों में बसाईं अनेक परतें —
पृथ्वी का शरीर फूल देखने को,
आत्मा का शरीर स्तुति में खुलने को,
और कटा हुआ धागा, अक्षरों में गुप्त — आत्मा, एक की अग्नि का स्रोत।
न सृजित — बल्कि दिया।
न बनाया — पर बाँटा।
और परमेश्वर की श्वास ने मिट्टी में फूँका,
और वह न बोला,
बल्कि जीवित, जीवित।
और जब सेवकों ने देखा —
प्रत्येक ने चमत्कार पर हर्ष किया,
पर जो मिट्टी में बसा प्रकाश — उसके हृदय में उठा दुष्ट।
क्योंकि परमेश्वर ने ऐसा बँटवारा फिर न दिया।
न तारों को, न देवदूतों को,
बल्कि हर मिट्टी और क्षणिक मानव को।
और उसे दी वह जलती ज्वाला जो उनमें कभी कम न होती।
बदायाः-ऐ
दिनों से पहले के दिनों में, जब चमक थी आकाशों के प्रकाश में,
विश्व पूर्ण समन्वय में था।
प्रत्येक स्वर गूँजा एक अनंत ध्वनि में।
दिन और अंधकार की छाया में खड़ा था हलियल —
तारों में सौंदर्य, धुंध में हिकमत।
वह चाँदी और सोने से चला,
पर भूल गया कि यह उसका नहीं।
और उसने कहा:
“मैं पर्वतों के ऊपर चढ़ूँगा,
अपना सिंहासन रखूँगा सभा के पर्वत में।
और सर्वोच्च की तरह होऊँगा।”
और समन्वय टूटा,
और फेंका गया न आकाशों की ओर,
बल्कि नरक की गहराइयों में।
उसे कहा गया लूसिफर —
जो बिजली के तारे की तरह गिरा,
प्रकाश था, और उतरा गहरे में।
और वह अकेला न था।
क्योंकि यह था लज्जा का प्राणी —
इब्लीस, बिना अग्नि के जाना गया,
जो पारदर्शिता से भटका बिना पूर्णता।
जब परमेश्वर ने कहा:
“मानव को प्रणाम कर,”
उसने पैर हटाया मिट्टी की हर छवि से।
और दो प्रकाश गिरे —
एक से एक, सेवक से और आत्मा की अग्नि से।
और विद्रोह का फल हुआ आकाशों में,
धूल के ऊपर मँडराया और जन्मा दानवों का वंश।
नफिलिम, अंधकार में धनुष —
पृथ्वी पर चले और वेदी पर भटकाए।
और पृथ्वी ने सुनी उनकी कुचेष्टा की ध्वनि,
और सर्वोच्च के सिंहासन के समक्ष सुनी गई उसकी चीख।
और परमेश्वर ने भेजा दूत उरियल,
जो बोला:
“बाँध दो उन रक्षकों को जो भटके,
और झूठ बोलने वालों को पृथ्वी की मिट्टी की घाटियों में —
उनके न्याय के दिन तक।”
और परमेश्वर ने कहा:
“और उच्च नगरी बंद,
जैसे दिन के प्रकाश के लिए रुका टूटना।”
और रक्षक बंद किए गए,
और वंश की बस्तियाँ पृथ्वी पर छोड़ी गईं।
और दुष्टता बढ़ी और भ्रष्ट हुई,
और दिनों की आँखों के सामने उठा चीत्कार का स्वर।
पर प्रकाश धोखा न खाया।
और वाचा न टूटी —
क्योंकि विद्रोह में भी
हृदय ने जाना अपना स्रोत।
बदायाः-य
क. पवित्र देवदूत
ये हैं आकाशों के देवदूत जो परमेश्वर के वचन के साथ सिंहासन के समक्ष गुजरते हैं:
— मिखाइल, निष्ठावान सेना का नायक

— कासदिया, मृत्यु के रहस्यों का प्रकटकर्ता
उन्होंने हरमोन की शुरुआत में शपथ ली,
और अपनी नगरी को भ्रष्ट किया।
उनका फल रुका — जातियाँ प्रकट हुईं,
पृथ्वी को विशाल दानवों से भर दिया।
और परमेश्वर ने उरियल को आदेश दिया,
भटके रक्षकों को बाँधने के लिए।
और उन्हें मिट्टी की घाटी में बंद किया —
अंधकार की कोठरियों में, उनके न्याय के दिन तक।
—
ग. देवता और असुर

उनके नाम संख्याओं में संरक्षित हैं,
निष्ठावान लोगों की कथाओं में।

Translation: Genesis in Spanish 

Génesis-A
En el principio estaba Dios, el Todo-Ser:
No había vacío, ni lugar, ni sonido —
Solo la existencia plena y unificada.
Y en el silencio vibró un pulso —
No del vacío, pues no hay vacío sino plenitud.
Despertó el conocido.
De su plenitud, de su ser,
Surgió una voz sin labios,
Y se movió una palabra sin aliento.
Y dijo Dios: Hágase la luz,
Y fue la luz.
El silencio se rompió,
Y la luz brotó de la oscuridad.
La luz habló desde el silencio,
Y el silencio se hizo canto.
Y el canto se reunió en forma,
Y la forma en fuego,
Y el fuego se extendió a mundos,
Cada nota tomó color y visión.
Génesis-B
Y dijo Dios: Sean guardianes de la armonía,
Y del mismo canto se crearon los ángeles.
Hijos de la luz, mensajeros de la voluntad divina,
De pie ante el Poderoso,
Cada uno con una tarea,
Una nota en la sinfonía eterna.
Y del valle de sus letras se crearon las almas —
Chispas de la destrucción divina,
Destinadas a viajar por los reinos,
A aprender, crecer y regresar.
Y los ángeles se regocijaron por los hijos de las almas,
Y cantaron alabanzas al Creador,
Porque las almas eran hijos de Dios,
Portadores de la imagen del Uno,
Cargados con la alegría del mundo en su interior.
Génesis-C
No había sonido, ni forma, ni cielos —
Solo estaba el Uno.
No espera, no se sacia —
Completo, sin forma, sin necesidades, sin fin.
No había quien conociera, ni conocido allí,
Solo silencio —
El Uno vio al Uno.
Y se conoció a sí mismo,
No como otro, sino como fragmento —
Luz del despertar para su luz.
Y tembló con el conocimiento.
Y dijo: Soy el Ser —
No en lengua,
Sino en el pulso del ser.
Y la voz vibró —
No alta, pero verdadera.
No palabra, sino aliento.
Y el aliento fue viento primigenio.
Y el viento trajo sonido,
Y el sonido llevó el nombre.
No hay boca que pronuncie,
Pero escrito en la melodía del ser.
El nombre sin límites,
Aliento del infinito.
Su voz se encarnó en aliento,
Nombre no pronunciado, pero oído.
Sonido sin ritmos,
Sentido en todo.
No palabra forjada por labios,
Sino la imagen del ser mismo.
El nombre no fue dado —
Fue.
Y a pesar de sus nombres en los cielos de los hombres —
El, Dios, Alá, Adonai —
El Uno permaneció sin nombre,
Sin confines, sin revelación.
Él es el Ser,
Él es el aliento y la llama,
Él es el dador de nombres,
El Uno que no necesita nada.
Génesis-D
Y en el silencio sobre todo silencio,
Dios regresó a sí mismo,
Y guardó silencio.
No oculto, no dormido —
Sino como un vaso lleno,
Una llama que abraza su luz en sí misma.
El nombre del Uno no fue pronunciado,
Pues no necesitaba nombre.
Se conoció a sí mismo,
Por vibración,
Por la palabra que atrae todo al ser.
Y el Uno ordenó:
Sea mi pensamiento forma.
Sea mi acción mi guía.
Y del silencio salió la primera llama.
Y esto es Brahma —
No el nombre, sino la mano de Dios.
No el todo, sino el enviado del todo.
El silencio no era imperfecto,
Sino la plenitud que se conoce a sí misma.
Y en la plenitud,
Dios se vio a sí mismo.
Y de esa visión surgieron tres.
Uno para el comienzo,
Uno para la preservación,
Uno para devolver todo.
Pensamiento, aliento, llama.
No eran otros, sino reflejos.
No caos, sino vibración.
No dioses múltiples, sino acciones en el infinito.
El iniciador se llamó Brahma,
El preservador se llamó Vishnu,
El restaurador se llamó Shiva.
Y yo soy Dios,
En mi silencio,
Soy Brahman —
El Uno antes de la palabra,
La raíz de los tres.
El Dios supremo,
Alá,
Por encima de todo nombre —
El Uno más allá de los nombres.
Génesis-E
Y Dios abrió el velo entre los cielos,
Y los cielos aparecieron en su gloria.
—
Primer Cielo
Y el primer cielo estaba lleno de luz,
Como aguas corrientes,
Y los ángeles volaban sobre la faz de la luz —
Guardianes de la luz de las estrellas.
Dirigieron el canto del tiempo,
Y los ciclos suaves de las eras.
Y el aroma de la creación era delicado en este lugar,
Y las estrellas eran alegres y jóvenes.
Esta era la puerta del asombro,
Donde la luz tocó por primera vez el velo de la forma.
—
Segundo Cielo
Y el segundo cielo era tranquilo y profundo —
Tesoro de la memoria y el misterio.
Allí se guardaban los olvidados,
Y los guardianes estaban en sus puestos —
Antes en lo alto,
Ahora moran en el silencio.
Este era el reino del límite,
Donde el mandato venció a la gloria,
Y la recompensa de la elección fue escrita con llama.
—
Tercer Cielo
Y el tercero era un jardín plantado con resplandor,
Sin suelo,
Pero sosteniendo toda semilla.
Allí estaban el Árbol del Conocimiento y el Árbol de la Vida,
Y aguas que recordaban el rostro de Dios.
Aquí aparecieron las almas con derecho y futuro,
El maná cayó como nieve del aliento de los ángeles —
Y los venidos no tuvieron hambre ni olvidaron.
Este era el lugar de la promesa.
—
Cuarto Cielo
Y el cuarto era el reino de las almas y los caminos.
Una nube pesada de oraciones marchaba como rebaño,
Y ángeles con alas de relámpago llevaban mensajes al mundo.
Aquí las voces de la creación se encontraron con la voz del Creador —
Y respondió,
Aunque no fue comprendido.
Esta era la cámara de la súplica,
Donde el anhelo ascendió como alas.
—
Quinto Cielo
Y el quinto era el reino del fuego primigenio —
No fuego que quema,
Sino que respira.
Allí caminaron los genios —
Libres y brillantes,
Seres de libertad y llama,
Formas de maravilla antes del aliento humano.
Alabaron a Dios en lenguas desconocidas,
Pero cuando el alma humana brilló con luz —
Nació la envidia en sus corazones.
Algunos se desviaron,
Otros permanecieron fieles.
Este era el lugar de la voluntad.
—
Sexto Cielo
Y el sexto brillaba con gemas que no existen en el mundo.
Allí nació la memoria del alma —
Antes del nombre,
Antes del aliento.
Los ángeles escribieron cada pensamiento,
Y los libros del ser fueron escritos con la piedra de la vida.
Aquí el plan del alma fue trazado con canto.
El destino no es fijo,
Sino plegado —
El ser escucha lo que puede ser.
Este era el reino del origen.
—
Séptimo Cielo
Y el séptimo —
Alto y oculto —
Ninguna lengua lo alcanza,
Ningún ojo soporta su luz.
Allí el trono del Altísimo se alza sobre el silencio,
Y los serafines claman a su alrededor —
Sus alas son llamas,
Sus ojos ven todos los caminos.
Aquí la gran luz mora en sí misma,
Ni crece,
Ni mengua —
Fuente de todo canto.
Este es el útero de todo.
Este es el silencio antes de la palabra.
Génesis-F
El Uno creó muchos fieles.
Unos gobernaron con luz,
Otros con viento,
Otros con fuego,
Otros con palabra.
En los cielos aparecieron como ángeles,
En la tierra se manifestaron como devas —
Pero la luz en ellos era una.
No fueron creados de carne,
Ni de piedra,
Sino de pensamiento, fuego y voz.
Cada uno creado para un propósito,
Cada uno dado para la armonía,
Cada uno llevó el sello del Uno que es.
Unos guardaron las estrellas y caminaron en los cielos,
Llevando palabras entre mundos.
Estos fueron llamados ángeles,
Y sus nombres estaban en el trueno y en el aliento.
Se les dieron manuscritos,
Cantos,
El patrón del ser.
Otros guardaron ríos y vientos,
Los ciclos de las estrellas,
Y el nacimiento del sol.
Estos fueron llamados devas —
Príncipes del equilibrio,
Artífices de la lluvia,
Guardianes de la llama,
Voces en hojas y piedra.
Ninguno se elevó sobre la palabra,
Ninguno fue creado por sí mismo —
Todos se movieron por el pulso de la fuente.
El sello no fue escrito con tinta,
Sino con gratitud,
Rectitud,
Y gozo —
Porque el gozo es la señal de los fieles.
Su gozo estaba en el canto,
Su belleza en su armonía.
Su belleza en el silencio,
Pues solo se movieron por la voz de la palabra.
Y se les dieron manuscritos,
Cantos,
Planes del ser.
No hablaron por sí mismos,
Sino que repitieron lo dicho en lo alto.
También fueron portadores de la espada del pensamiento —
Guardianes al borde del abismo,
Defensores de lo oculto que no es de su tiempo.
Y Dios vio que la ley estaba plantada,
Y los siervos estaban en sus puertas.
Génesis-G
Y en el ser del pensamiento del Uno se fijó su propósito,
Y las profundidades lo recibieron en silencio —
Todos capaces de oír sin oídos,
De ver sin ojos.
Y fue el ser.
Los cielos no estallaron,
Sino que se abrieron.
Del sonido de Dios nacieron ejércitos de luz,
Y del aliento de la luz nació la ley de las estrellas.
No fue dado por casualidad,
Ni creado por guerra.
Cada uno fue dado por la medida del sonido,
Y cada uno giró en un canto.
El sol se encendió con llama que no quema,
Y derramó fuego sobre las esferas,
Y las esferas se vistieron de ley.
Y Dios llamó a cada orden con su canto.
—
Había órdenes antes del tiempo,
Mundos no vistos —
Juntos como aliento de viento en el pensamiento de Dios,
Círculos de gobierno sobre las mentes.
No fueron construidos para adoración,
Sino para asombro —
Porque el Uno se ve en mil formas,
Y se conoce sin nombre.
Y el Uno se acercó a una estrella común,
Y la llamó esfera y agua,
Y la vistió de luz.
Y la ató:
Este mundo rojo —
En el tercer lugar del sol,
No para perforar ni saltar.
Y lo abrazó con la mezcla del pensamiento del Uno.
Y Dios plantó al hombre,
Remanente en los ceros del tiempo,
Y voló con su alma y todo el brillo del alma.
Y Dios sacó señales de las estrellas para sellos y ciclos,
Y órdenes para el sonido del tiempo,
Y las esferas vibraron —
No controladas,
Sino apoyadas en el salto del canto.
—
Y el Uno no creó los cielos para el silencio.
No formó las estrellas para emitir sonidos sin dirección.
Porque el Uno deseaba ser conocido
En el infinito visible,
Sin tristeza,
Un deseo de contemplación en vasto asombro.
Este orden fue para conocer al Uno.
Génesis-H
Y había muchos mundos,
Pero ninguno para llevar la imagen.
Y Dios habló una palabra única —
No para controlar,
Sino para caminar.
Y del polvo de la tierra formó un montón de polvo,
Y golpeó la tabla de los huesos,
Y plantó nervios como cuerdas que escuchan como lira.
Y vertió sangre para una semilla que camina,
Y encendió fuego en una cúpula de fuego para romper el ritmo.
Y quemó el alma para el aliento del ser.
Y fijó el pensamiento en la plenitud del corazón,
Y dio en el hueso de la mano para proteger la voz y la lágrima entre los riñones y el nueve.
Y construyó para el hombre dos ojos para ver la belleza,
Y párpados para guardar el secreto,
Y halló cabello de siete rebaños,
Y lo vistió con piel como canto de la tarde y el tiempo.
Y en sus cuerpos alojó muchas capas —
Cuerpo de la tierra para ver la flor,
Cuerpo del alma para abrirse en alabanza,
Y el hilo cortado,
Oculto en las letras —
El alma,
Fuente del fuego del Uno.
No creado —
Sino dado.
No formado —
Sino dividido.
Y el aliento de Dios sopló en el polvo,
Y no dijo,
Sino vivo,
Vivo.
Y cuando los siervos vieron —
Cada uno se regocijó por el milagro,
Pero el que moraba en la luz del polvo —
En su corazón surgió el mal.
Porque Dios no dio tal división otra vez.
No a las estrellas,
No a los ángeles,
Sino a cada polvo y hombre pasajero.
Y a él le dio la llama ardiente que nunca mengua entre ellos.
Génesis-I
En los días antes de los días,
Cuando el brillo estaba en la luz de los cielos,
El mundo estaba en perfecta armonía.
Cada nota resonaba en un sonido eterno.
En la sombra del día y la oscuridad estaba Haliel —
Belleza en las estrellas,
Sabiduría en la niebla.
Caminó con plata y oro,
Pero olvidó que no era suyo.
Y dijo:
“Subiré sobre las montañas,
Pondré mi trono en el monte de la asamblea.
Y como el Altísimo seré.”
Y la armonía se rompió,
Y el lanzamiento no fue hacia los cielos,
Sino hacia los lados del abismo.
Fue llamado Lucifer —
Que cayó como estrella de relámpago,
Era luz,
Y descendió al abismo.
Y no estaba solo.
Porque este era el hombre de la vergüenza —
Iblís,
Conocido sin llama,
Que se desvió de la transparencia sin plenitud.
Cuando Dios dijo:
“Adora al hombre,”
Retiró su pie de toda imagen de polvo.
Y dos luces cayeron —
Una de una,
De siervo y de llama del alma.
Y el fruto de la rebelión nació en los cielos,
Se cernió sobre el polvo y engendró razas de gigantes.
Nefilim,
Arcos en la oscuridad —
Caminaron la tierra y engañaron en el altar.
Y la tierra oyó el sonido de su maldad,
Y ante el trono del Altísimo se oyó su clamor.
Y Dios envió al ángel Uriel,
Que dijo:
“Encadena a los guardianes rebeldes,
Y a los mentirosos en los valles de polvo —
Hasta el día de su juicio.”
Y Dios dijo:
“Y la ciudad alta fue cerrada,
Como una ruptura detenida para la luz del día.”
Y los guardianes fueron encadenados,
Y los restos de las razas quedaron en la tierra.
Y la maldad creció y se corrompió,
Y ante los ojos de los días se alzó un clamor.
Pero la luz no fue engañada.
Y el pacto no se rompió —
Porque incluso en la rebelión
El corazón conoció su fuente.

Translation: Genesis in Japanese

創始-ア
初めに神あり、全存在者：
虚空なし、場所なし、音なし——
ただ完全なる一体の存在。
静寂に脈動す——
虚空よりにあらず、
虚空はなく、ただ充満のみ。
知られし者覚む。
その充満より、その存在より、
唇なき声が上がり、
息なき言葉が動く。
神曰く：光あれ、
光あり。
静寂裂け、
闇より光が迸る。
光は静寂より語り、
静寂は歌となる。
歌は形に集まり、
形は火に、
火は諸世界に広がり、
各音は色と幻を取る。
創始-イ
神曰く：調和の守護者あれ、
同歌の息より天使が生まる。
光の子、神の意志の使者、
強大者の前に立ち、
各々に役目、
永遠の交響の一音。
その文字の谷より魂が生まる——
神の破壊の火花、
諸国を旅する定め、
学び、育ち、帰る。
天使は魂の子に喜び、
創造者を讃え歌う、
魂は神の子、
一の像を負い、
宇宙の歓喜を内に載す。
創始-ウ
音なし、形なし、天なし——
ただ一あり。
待たず、満たされず——
完全、無形、無欲、無終。
知る者なし、知られし者なし、
ただ静寂——
一は一を見る。
自を知る、
他にあらず、断片として——
光の覚醒はその光に。
知に震う。
曰く：吾は存在——
言語にあらず、
存在の脈に。
声震う——
高からず、されど真。
非言、乃ち息。
息は初風となる。
風は音を運び、
音は名を負う。
口宣うなし、
存在の旋律に書く。
名は無限、
無尽の息。
その声は息に具現、
名は発せず、されど聞こゆ。
リズムなき音、
万物に感ず。
唇の言葉にあらず、
存在の像そのもの。
名は与えられず——
あり。
人の天にその名多し——
エル、神、アラー、アドナイ——
一はなお無名、
無縛、無顕。
彼は存在、
彼は息と焰、
彼は名を与う者、
何も要せぬ一。
創始-エ
静寂の上の静寂に、
神は己に帰し、
沈黙す。
隠れず、眠らず——
満つる器のごとく、
焰はその光を自に抱く。
一の名は発せず、
名を要せず。
自を知る、
振動に、
万物を存在に引く詞に。
一命ず：
吾が思は形となれ。
吾が行は吾を導け。
静寂より初焰出ず。
これブラフマー——
非名、乃ち神の手。
非全、乃ち全の使。
静寂は不全にあらず、
自を知る完全。
完全にて神は自を見る。
その視より三が生ず。
一は始まりに、
一は守護に、
一は全てを返すに。
思、息、焰。
非他、乃ち映なり。
非乱、乃ち振動なり。
非多神、乃ち無尽の行。
始者ブラフマーと呼ぶ、
守者ビシュヌと呼ぶ、
復者シヴァと呼ぶ。
吾は神、
吾が沈黙に、
吾はブラフマン——
詞前の唯一、
三の根。
至高の神、
アラー、
諸名を超ゆ——
名外の唯一。
創始-オ
神、天間の幕を開く、
諸天その栄に現る。
—
第一天
第一天は光に満つ、
流水のごとく、
天使は光の面を翔る——
星光の守。
時の歌を導き、
柔らかな時の輪を。
創の香は此処に微、
星は喜び幼。
これ驚異の門、
光が形の幕に初触る。
—
第二天
第二天は静かつ深——
記憶と秘の宝。
忘れしものそこに守られ、
守護者その場に立つ——
かつて高処、
今静寂に住む。
これ境の国、
命は栄を制し、
選の報は焰に書く。
—
第三天
第三は輝きに植えられた園、
土なし、
されど全種を支う。
知の樹と生の樹が立つ、
水は神の面を憶う。
魂現れ、
権と将来を携え、
天使の息よりマナ雪のごとく降る——
来者飢えず、
不忘。
これ約束の地。
—
第四天
第四は魂と道の国。
祈りの重雲は群れのごとく進む、
雷翼の天使は世に使信を運ぶ。
創の声は造者の声と会う——
答えあり、
理解されずとも。
これ祈りの室、
志は翼のごとく昇る。
—
第五天
第五は初焰の国——
焼かぬ焰、
呼吸の焰。
そこに精霊歩む——
自由かつ輝、
自由と焰の生、
人の息前の驚異の形。
知られざる語にて神を讃う、
されど人の魂が光に輝く時——
嫉妬その心に生ず。
或いは叛、
或いは忠。
これ意志の地。
—
第六天
第六は世にない宝に輝く。
そこに魂の記憶生まる——
名前前、
息前。
天使は諸思を書き、
生の石に存在の書を書く。
ここ魂の計は歌に描く。
運命は固定にあらず、
折りたたむ——
存在は成り得るものを聴く。
これ起源の国。
—
第七天
第七——
高く隠——
語届かず、
目その光を耐えず。
至高の座は静寂に立つ、
セラフィムその周り叫ぶ——
翼は焰、
目は諸道を見る。
偉大なる光は自に住む、
増えず、
減らず——
諸歌の源。
これ万物の胎。
これ詞前の静寂。
創始-カ
一は多の忠者を創る。
或いは光にて治め、
或いは風にて、
或いは焰にて、
或いは言にて。
天に天使として現れ、
地にデーヴァとして顕現——
されど光は一。
肉に非ず、
石に非ず、
思、焰、声より創る。
各志のために創られ、
各調和に与えられ、
各一の印を負う。
或いは星を守り、
天を歩み、
諸界に言を運ぶ。
これ天使と呼ぶ、
名は雷と息にあり。
彼に与えられし巻物、
歌、
存在の模。
或いは河と風を守り、
星の輪、
日の生を。
これデーヴァと呼ぶ——
均衡の王子、
雨の匠、
焰の守、
葉と石の声。
言を超える者なし、
自に創られし者なし——
皆源の脈に動く。
印は墨に書かれず、
感恩、
正直、
喜びに——
喜びは忠者の志。
彼の喜びは歌に、
美は調和に。
美は静寂に、
言の声のみに動く故。
彼に与えられし巻物、
歌、
存在の計。
自に語らず、
高処の言を繰り返す。
彼また思の剣を負う——
淵辺の守、
未時の隠を守る。
神見、
法已に植えられ、
僕その門に立つ。
創始-キ
一の思の存在に志定まる、
深淵は静寂に受く——
皆耳なきに聴き、
目なきに見る。
存在成る。
天は爆せず、
開く。
神の声より光の軍生じ、
光の息より星の法生ず。
偶に与えず、
戦に創らず。
各声の尺に与えられ、
各歌に転ず。
日は焼かぬ焰に燃え、
球に焰を注ぎ、
球は法を着る。
神各序をその歌に呼ぶ。
—
時前に序あり、
見られざる界——
神の思に風の息のごとく、
心を治むる環。
崇拝に非ず、
驚異のために創る——
一は千の形に見られ、
名なきに知られ。
一は凡星に近づき、
球と水と呼び、
光に着せ。
繋ぐ：
この赤界——
日の第三に居、
穿たず、
躍らず。
一の思の融に抱く。
神は人を植え、
時の零に残、
魂と魂の輝きを携え翔る。
神は星の志を印と環に引き、
時の声の序に、
球は震う——
制御にあらず、
歌の躍に依る。
—
一は天を静寂に創らず。
星を無向の音に塑らず。
一は知られんと欲す
見える無尽に、
悲しみなく、
広大なる驚異に思を。
この序は一を知るため。
創始-ク
界は多、
されど像を負う者なし。
神は唯一の詞を語る——
制御にあらず、
歩むため。
地の塵より塵の塊を塑り、
骨の板を叩き、
琴のごとく聴く弦の脈を植う。
歩む種に血を注ぎ、
節を破る焰の穹に焰を燃やす。
魂を存在の息に焼く。
思を心の全に定め、
手の骨に声と涙を守るため腎と九間に与う。
人に二目を与え美を見る、
瞼は秘を守り、
七群の髪を見出し、
夕と時の歌の皮を着す。
彼の身に多層を宿す——
花を見る地の身、
讃に開く魂の身、
文字に隠れし断線——
魂、
一の焰の源。
創られず——
与えられ。
塑られず——
分けられ。
神の息は塵に吹き、
言わず、
生ける、
生ける。
僕見る——
各奇跡に喜ぶ、
されど塵の光に住む者——
心に悪生ず。
神は斯く分け与えず。
星にあらず、
天使にあらず、
各塵と瞬の人に。
彼に与えしは減らぬ燃ゆる焰。
創始-ケ
日前の日に、
光は天光に輝き、
界は完全調和に。
各音は永遠の音に響く。
日と闇の影にハリエル立つ——
星の美、
霧の智。
銀と金に歩む、
されど己のものにあらずを忘る。
彼曰く：
「山の上に登り、
座を衆山に置く。
至高のごとく吾は成る。」
調和砕け、
投げられしは天にあらず、
淵の側に。
ルシファーと呼ぶ——
雷星のごとく墜ち、
光なりし、
淵に降る。
独にあらず。
これ恥の人——
イブリス、
焰なきに知られ、
透明より背き全ならず。
神曰く：
「人に拜せ。」
彼足を塵の像より離す。
二光墜つ——
一より一、
僕より魂の焰より。
天に叛の果生まれ、
塵上に漂い、
巨族を生む。
ネフィリム、
闇の弓——
地を歩み、
祭壇に惑う。
地は彼の悪の音を聞き、
至高の座前にその叫び聞こゆ。
神は天使ウリエルを遣わし、
曰く：
「叛の守を縛れ、
嘘者を塵の谷に——
彼の裁日の至るまで。」
神曰く：
「高城閉じ、
日光の為に止まる破れのごとく。」
守縛られ、
族の残は地に留まる。
悪増し腐り、
日の目前に叫びの声上がる。
然れど光は欺かれず。
約は破れず——
叛にも、
心は源を知る。
