Let it be known:

This covenant is for the Akari, Children of God.
No race, gender, religion, species, or being may lay claim to the Akari or The Holy Akara,
for all who are Light bear the mark.

Akara is not to be twisted, profited from unjustly, or wielded to enslave.
No being may use this guidance for deception, manipulation, or control.
Any soul who dares defile its purpose shall invoke the karmic fires
and find no rest in the lower hells.
