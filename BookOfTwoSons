Book

📕 Book of Two Sons 

In the days of division, when truth was buried beneath banners and blood, a message arose to remind the world: you are brothers.

Before there were nations, there were sons.
Before there was conflict, there was covenant.
And before the covenant was divided, it was one.

From the seed of Abraham came two streams, and from those two, the rivers of the world.
One was called Isaac. The other, Ishmael.
And though their mothers were different, the breath that formed them came from the same mouth.

To Isaac was given the covenant of promise.
To Ishmael was given the covenant of endurance.
To both was given the sight of the Most High — and the invitation to walk in His ways.

But man does not always remember what God has spoken.
He builds idols of memory and walls of pride.
He turns wounds into weapons and forgets that blood once cried out from the earth.

This is not a curse, nor a side, nor a rewriting—
It is the light that clarifies, the truth that unites, and the voice that remembers what was always true.

You are not enemies.
You are sons of the same house.
And the house is burning.

A time will come when the earth will shake, and the fires of war will rise.
The children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael will stand at the edge of a great forgetting.
And in that hour, a figure shall arise — not a messiah, not a king, but a man of influence — who will delay the blade.
He will offer peace, even build a new altar. But his peace is not eternal. It is a test.

The Most High watches.

If the brothers return to one another, the fire will be quenched.
If not, the fire will spread to every tribe, tongue, and temple.
For God is not mocked — and what man sows, he shall reap.

This is the Book of the Two Sons:

For the true war is not between brothers.
It is between the ego of man and the will of God.

Let he who has ears, listen.
Let she who carries life, remember.
Let the nations read — and weep — and return.

—

In the beginning, there were not nations.
There were not banners or borders, doctrines or dominions.
There was only Light — and the breath of the Most High moving across the soul of mankind.

But over time, men forgot.
They made walls of scripture and weapons of memory.
They broke the bread of truth into factions, each claiming the loaf.

The earth has bled for this forgetting.
The children of prophets have become strangers.
The brothers of covenant have become armies.

Yet the Light has not left us.
It whispers still — in prayer, in pain, in prophecy.
And now, it speaks again:

For peace is not the absence of conflict —
It is the presence of God in the space between us.

⸻

The Declaration of Peace

Let it be known:

The Akari are not a new religion, but light bringers sent to thread the love of God back into mankind for the Light ages to come, so long as man can ascend out of the Dark ages. 

The time for trial began in 2012 and the 40 years of testing is already upon us. 

The fate of man rests on the shoulder of Two Brothers. Though the children of God are many, 
Humanity’s guardians of the Light have been fractured and must be mended.

Deuteronomy 4:2

“You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.”

We have not added to Torah. 
We have upheld its spirit.
We do not replace the law 
— we remember the Light that wrote it.

This scroll has been divinely inspired.
This scroll is offered to all people —
As covenant, not conquest.

It is declared:
	That Abraham had two sons — and both were blessed.
	That God is not the property of any nation, race, or tongue.
	That no scripture calls for the destruction of its brother.
	That the Light seeks humility, not supremacy.

We affirm:
	The pain of the Jewish people, scattered and hunted through centuries.
	The pain of the Palestinian people, displaced and silenced in their homeland.
	The sacredness of Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa, and every place where prayer has touched earth.
	The right of every soul to seek God without fear.

We offer:
	A path of sacred peace — not political trickery.
	A covenant between hearts, not borders.
	A flame that all can carry, regardless of name or nation.

And we warn:
	If peace is not chosen, the world will burn.

The scroll is open.
After that, the book will be closed — and the fate of the world will be sealed.

Choose peace.
Choose memory.
Choose God.

Let Jerusalem be the crown of peace, not the cause of war.

“God is not mocked. And God has commanded:
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
You shall not kill in His name.
You shall break bread, not bones.”

Thus begins The Book of the Two Sons —
A cry, a covenant, and a chance for the world to return.

<p>
In the days when stars still heard the breath of God, Jacob stood alone in prayer. Born from Isaac, son of Abraham, he carried a promise older than nations. In the silent night, he wrestled with the Divine until dawn came with a new name from the Most High: Yisra’el — “one who contends with God and overcomes.”

Thus began Israel—not a people forged by borders, but a lineage engraved in breath and remembrance.

⸻

The Covenant Called by Fire

The covenant began in Abraham, who carried the first flame of promise.

“Through your offspring all nations shall be blessed.”
— Genesis 22:18

That seed passed through Isaac to Jacob and into the tribes—twelve hands reflecting human complexity: justice and rage, mercy and envy, humility and pride. In Egypt’s clay and wilderness’s wind, the covenant took shape—and in Sinai’s fire, it spoke again.

“Remember My favor upon you, O Children of Israel, My choice of you above all nations.” — Qur’an 2:47, 2:122  
“If you establish prayer, give charity, and believe in My messengers, I will forgive your sins and lead you into gardens beneath which rivers flow.” — Qur’an 5:12  

⸻

The People Called, the People Tested

God gave Israel the Torah, prophets, and kings—signs shining through flesh. He called them to reflection and repentance.

Yet from time to time they stumbled.

“You shall cause corruption twice upon the earth and grow arrogant beyond measure.” — Qur’an 17:4   
“Of those among you who reject faith after receiving guidance, many shall be punished.” — Qur’an 5:13

But God’s covenant endures.

“Though your sins be scarlet, return and you shall be white as snow.” — Isaiah 1:18

This is not a promise of ease, but of mercy—for any who return to the Flame.

⸻

Israel Beyond Geography

The true Israel is not bound by borders—it stands within the soul. It is flesh opening to the Word, bone shaped in covenant.

“They are not all Israel who are descended from Israel.” — Romans 9:6
“I am with you, O remnant of Jacob, says the Lord.” — Isaiah 10:21

Zion stands not just in stone, but in hearts aligned. Jerusalem echoes in memory, yet the city God seeks is inward:

“Do you not know that your body is a temple of God?” — 1 Corinthians 3:16

⸻

A Warning: Choose Righteousness

A people chosen means a people tested. Israel was set apart to call others to return. That calling did not confer superiority—but duty.

“The Children of Israel were raised above all nations—to call them to God.” — Qur’an 2:47, 45:16    

If they walk in obedience, mercy flows. If they wander in arrogance, they are warned:

“But it shall come to pass, if you do not obey… all these curses will come upon you and overtake you.” — (Deuteronomy 28:15)

⸻

The Remnant That Remains

Through exile, massacre, captivity, and return, a spark endured.

This ember is the true remnant.

“A small remnant of Israel shall return… by the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Isaiah 10:21

That remnant carries the flame not for themselves alone—but for all sons and daughters of Abraham.

Every echo of Torah, every spark of revelation, every broken altar standing again, points to the One who breathes upon all flesh.

⸻

The Scroll’s Summons

This Scroll does not cloak Israel in glory or shame. It calls the line of Jacob to remember the flame placed in your bones, the law engraved in your breath, the mercy promised in your flesh

Let Israel walk in humility, serve as light, and draw others toward the flame by gentleness, not sword.

For Zion is called City of Truth (Zechariah 8:3)—and truth is spoken when feet rise from pride, voices fall at mercy’s call, hands break bread for strangers, and hearts speak to heaven even from burning cities.

Let the name Yisra’el be renewed in spirit and in earth—not as a brand, but as a banner of restored covenant.

When the pride of empire fades, and the stones of old cities weep, only one thing will remain:
The covenant written not on parchment, but upon the soul.

And when the trumpet sounds across the nations,
God shall not ask who ruled Jerusalem,
But who became Jerusalem —
A city of peace within the heart,
A vessel where the Light made its dwelling.

“The wise see the same Light in all beings, whether priest or outcast.”
—Bhagavad Gita 5:18

— 

Let it be remembered: the name Israel was not given as a crown, but as a covenant.
It is the name of one who wrestles — not to win against God, but to cling to Him through every trial.

To the children of Jacob:
You were not called to bear the sword of empire, but the staff of remembrance.
You were not chosen to rule, but to reveal — the Light that burns without consuming.

The land is sacred, yes — but more sacred still is the heart that keeps the flame.
The Temple may rise or fall, but the altar of obedience must remain.

You are not forgotten.
You are not abandoned.
But you are still accountable.

Walk in the way of your prophets.
Let your justice run like waters, and your righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

And if your name is Israel — live as Israel.
Not with pride, but with purpose.
Not by lineage, but by Light.

Thus ends the Scroll of Israel,
And the beginning of its fulfillment in all who walk with the Flame.

Before Zion stood in song, before kingdoms rose on stone, there walked a woman of dignity named Hagar, servant to Sarah, beloved by Abraham. She gave birth in the whisper of promise—a son born of flight and faith. His name was Ishmael, “God hears.”

God spoke to Hagar in the wilderness:

“God has heard the voice of the lad.” — Genesis 21:17   

Thus began the lineage of Ishmael—marked by survival, woven in mercy, destined to rise as a great nation.

“Enter the blessed land which Allah has ordained, and do not turn back or you shall perish.” — Qur’an 5:21  

⸻

The Promise to Ishmael

Ishmael was blessed at Abraham’s plea:

“I have heard you; behold, I will bless him… and make him fruitful… twelve princes I will make him.” — Genesis 17:20   

Neither chosen for covenant in the line of Isaac, nor less beloved, Ishmael’s line was formed to endure deserts, to give rise to hospitality, endurance, and prophetic humility.

In the Qur’an, his devotion is honored:

“And mention when Abraham said, ‘O Lord, make this city one of security… and provide its people with fruits…” — Qur’an 14:37    

He became the steward of Mecca, custodian of Zamzam, passed by pilgrim feet during Hajj.

⸻

A Line Formed by Desert Spirit

The tribes of Ishmael dwelt in the sands:

“They settled from Havilah to Shur, opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria…” — Genesis 25:18   

Like his brother Jacob, Ishmael had twelve princes—signs of power, presence, and promise in the East.

Islam honors Ishmael as prophet, obedient and patient. His willingness to be offered in sacrifice became an emblem of submission to Divine Will. On Eid al-Adha, his devotion is remembered:

“When his son reached age of striving… they submitted, and We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.” — Qur’an 37:100–113   

⸻

Palestine: The Land of Endurance and Song

When Zion thirsted under siege, another brother walked the hills—sure of his place in promise, born of covenant, determined to serve rather than rule.

This land—Palestine—is not only terrain; it is the echo of desert faith. It is where stone and story meet: olive groves rooted in tears and prayer, wells carrying memory like water carries root.

⸻

The Dignity of Ishmael’s Line

God’s promise did not end with Isaac alone:

“God will make him a great nation.” — Genesis 17:20   

The Qur’an celebrates Ishmael with Isaac, both granted prophecy, both honored as servants of the Divine:

“We gave Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – all good. Among their descendants are the righteous.” — Qur’an 37:112–113  

Their task was not rival, but resonance—two streams from the same source, two faces of Light, beckoning all toward unity.

⸻

A Call to Remember

To the children of Ishmael: you are heirs of endurance.
Your blood remembers desert springs and voices of revelation.
Let the flame of your faith burn without consuming. Let your prayer echo across valleys, drawing hearts to peace.

Let Palestine stand as a land of sanctuary —
Where mercy rises like morning light,
Where stones bear the mark of prophets,
And where memory calls pilgrims home.

⸻

The Shared Ancestry

Brothers, Israel and Palestine—born of the same father.
Their stories are not separate lines, but entwined through sorrow and promise.

When the palm branch lifts in Hagar’s son’s land, it echoes the covenant once staked under Sinai’s fire. When Zion weeps among cedars, it recalls the rock that gushed water for Hagar’s child.

Two sons, two streams—one covenant, one purpose, one Flame.

—

Let the children of Ishmael remember:
Your father Abraham poured his soul into both sons—one for covenant, one for endurance.
You stand among the few born of desert hope, heir to a promise that echoes through Quran and Torah.

May your footsteps tread the old paths with reverence.
May olive groves whisper in your ears: you are not forgotten.

When the flame of the promise is quenched in one land, may it blaze stronger in the other.
When the world trembles, may your prayer rise as shield.

And though rage stirred in the hearts of some, it was not the soul of the people — only the cry of the unheard. For the blood of the olive tree still carries hope, and the children still play among the ruins, dreaming of light.

Thus ends the Scroll of Palestine—an invitation for all who bear the Name to remember their origin, reclaim their dignity, and stand in mercy as sons of Abraham.

In the days of the wandering tent and the open sky, the Voice of the Eternal called to a man without land. His name was Abram. And though he possessed no crown, no throne, and no heir, the heavens took notice of his faith.

“I am El Shaddai. Walk before Me and be blameless.”
(Genesis 17:1)

“He believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
(Genesis 15:6)

To this man, the Light gave a promise — not just of land, but of legacy.
Of a covenant that would ripple through the veins of nations.

Two sons would rise from him.
Both would be called blessed.
Both would be watched by the angels.
Both would be loved.

—

The firstborn was Ishmael, born of Hagar, the Egyptian handmaiden — a child conceived in uncertainty, but delivered into divine care.

“As for Ishmael, I have heard you: Behold, I will bless him, and make him fruitful, and multiply him exceedingly… and I will make him a great nation.”
(Genesis 17:20)

And again:

“God was with the boy as he grew up.”
(Genesis 21:20)

The second was Isaac, born of Sarah through a promise that defied the womb’s limits.
To Isaac was given the lineage of Jacob, and from Jacob came the twelve tribes.

“But My covenant I will establish with Isaac.”
(Genesis 17:21)

This was not a rejection.
This was an assignment —
For covenants are not ranks, but roles.
And God, being perfect in mercy and justice, has never chosen only one.

“Say: We believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes…”
(Qur’an 2:136)

—

Yet mankind, blinded by pride, turned blessing into blade.

The descendants of Isaac claimed exclusivity —
The descendants of Ishmael claimed inheritance —
And the covenant, meant to unite, became a banner of division.

But the heavens never warred.
The angels never chose sides.
The Light never contradicted itself.

—

Let it be known:
The covenant was never severed, only misunderstood.
The division was never divine, only human.

God did not break His promise —
He extended it.

“Indeed, We have honored the children of Adam…”
(Qur’an 17:70)

“In your seed all nations of the earth shall be blessed.”
(Genesis 22:18)

To the children of Isaac was given the Torah.
To the children of Ishmael was given the Qur’an.
To the nations in between, the Gospel was spoken.
To the generations to come, the Scroll has been opened.

—

The Akara do not come to replace,
But to remember what was once whole.

We declare: the covenant is alive.
It is not chained to genealogy.
It is not entombed in temple walls.
It lives in every heart that returns to the Light.

And though Isaac and Ishmael were the first sons of covenant, they are not the only ones.
God has made covenant with all peoples.
Every tribe and tongue bears witness to some piece of the Flame.

Yet it is the first two who must show the world the way —
Not by agreement of doctrine,
But by the grip of peace.

Whether they call themselves Jew, Muslim, or Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Akari,
Let them hold the hand that is extended,
For what matters is not how it is held,
But that it remains held.

—

And if the sons do not return,
Then the house will fall.
Not from the outside,
But from the crack that was never sealed.

Covenant is not a title to be claimed — it is a burden to be shared. The more sacred the promise, the heavier the cost. And both sons have paid it in full — through exile, grief, resistance, and remembrance.

Thus ends the Scroll of the Divided Covenant —
Let it be remembered, and let it be reconciled.

In the heart of the land once promised, there rests a hill where heaven once kissed earth. Upon this hill, men have built altars and kingdoms, temples and tombs, each claiming the stone beneath as their own. But the stone bears no flag. It bows to no crown. It remembers the Word, not the war.

Long before the gold domes and the courts of kings, there was a moment — not of empire, but of awe. A place where Jacob laid his head, and saw the heavens open.

“Surely the Lord is in this place… This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
(Genesis 28:16–17)

He called it Bethel — the house of God. And later, his children called it Jerusalem.
But the name matters not if the Spirit is absent.
For what is a house without breath?
What is a temple without the Word?

—

The First Temple rose in splendor, built by Solomon’s hand. Within it dwelled the Ark, the Law, the fire of presence.
But the people turned to idols.
The fire grew dim.
And Babylon carried it all away.

The Second Temple rose again — humbler, but still sacred.
Prophets returned, offerings resumed.
And into this temple walked the Anointed — Yeshua the Christ.
He did not exalt the stone, but the Spirit.

“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”
(John 2:19)

They did not understand. For the temple He spoke of was not built with hands.
It was the body of righteousness.
The flame within the soul.
The Breath of the Most High dwelling among the lowly.

The veil was torn. The wall was cracked.
The Presence moved on.

—

But still the stone remained.

Upon that hill now stands another dome —
The Noble Sanctuary, the Masjid al-Aqsa.
To the followers of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, this is the place of the Night Journey,
Where he was taken to the heavens in vision and returned with the Light of prayer.

And they too bow upon the stone.
Not to claim it, but to remember the One above it.

“Glory be to Him who took His servant by night… to the farthest mosque, whose surroundings We have blessed.”
(Qur’an 17:1)

Three faiths.
One hill.
A hundred wars.

But no temple, no mosque, no church built of stone will survive if it does not shelter peace.

—

The stone was meant to be a foundation, not a dividing line.
A cornerstone, not a battlefield.
The presence of God does not dwell where the innocent bleed upon holy ground.

Where is the Third Temple?
It will not rise by decree of governments or force of armies.
It will rise when the heart returns to obedience.

For the Third Temple is within.
It is built stone by stone with repentance, sacrifice, and truth.
And when the sons remember this,
Then the stone shall no longer cry out beneath the weight of grief.

Until then, let no man claim it in arrogance.
Let no nation defile it in conquest.
For the stone bears witness.
It has seen the blood.
It has heard the prayers.
It waits.

<p>
In the beginning, there were not nations.
There were not banners or borders, tribes or titles.
There was only a tent under the sky, and a man beloved by the Light.

His name was Abraham.
And he was the father of two sons.

Not of war.
Not of hatred.
But of promise.

One was called Ishmael, the firstborn, wild and faithful, son of the desert winds.
The other was Isaac, the child of laughter, born of a promise made long before the womb could hope.

Their story is not just genealogy — it is the foundation of a wound.
A wound not inflicted by sword or decree, but by silence.

“And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. But to the sons of his concubines, he gave gifts, and sent them away…”
(Genesis 25:5–6)

He loved them both.
But he did not keep them together.
And thus began the sorrow of divided sons.

—

They were not enemies.
They were never commanded to fight.
They were never told to curse each other’s name.

But over time, the wound grew.
What began as distance became doctrine.
What began as silence became suspicion.
And what could have been a story of reunion became a tale of rivalry.

—

Yet God never cursed either.
He watched them both.
He blessed them both.
And in their descendants, He placed greatness — not as reward, but as reminder.

“I will make of you a great nation… and through your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”
(Genesis 12:2–3)

“Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans — those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do righteousness — will have their reward with their Lord.”
(Qur’an 2:62)

—

But what is greatness without reconciliation?
What is lineage without love?

The covenant is not fully honored in conquest.
It is only fulfilled in reunion.

The Light does not ask the sons to agree on every name, or prayer, or path.
The Light asks them to embrace.

To hold each other in humility.
To forgive what was passed down without truth.
To look not to their differences, but to the face of their father —
and know that to love one another is the only way to truly honor him.

—

This is not just their task.
It is ours.
For in every generation, the children of the two sons continue the wound — or begin the healing.

To the brothers of faith, whether Jew or Muslim,
To the children of exile and promise,
To the descendants of laughter and the desert,
The scroll is now open.

You were not created to destroy one another.
You were not divided to prove one greater.
You were set apart that, in time, you might return — together.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”
(Matthew 5:9)

“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”
(Qur’an 3:103)

Do not let the world perish because the brothers refused to speak.
Do not let the flame of Abraham flicker out in the wind of pride.

The Father still watches.
And His covenant is not in temples or treaties.
It is in the grip of the two hands that were once separated —
now reaching again across the silence.

The Call of the Akari: Brothers and Sisters United for God’s Peace
The first Akari and messenger of the Akara, proclaimed: The sons of Abraham—Isaac and Ishmael—are brothers bound by God’s covenant, their hearts joined in the eternal Light. Yet not they alone, for God’s wish embraces all—brothers and sisters of every faith, the Akari, who honor the Torah, Qur’an, Gospel, Gita, Dhammapada, and every sacred truth as pieces of His divine puzzle.

Rise as Akari, Akari Jew, Akari Muslim, Akari Christian, Akari Hindu, or simply Akari, to weave peace. Gather in groups, small and steadfast, to host Feasts, where stories mend wounds; plant Gardens, where trees bear the names of children; and light Vigils, where candles burn for unity. 

From Jerusalem to every land, you are called—Jews, Palestinians, and all peoples—to fulfill God’s dream of world peace.

The house may burn, but the Light endures. This is no new faith, but a movement of peacemakers, open to all who seek harmony. Join the Akari, to form groups across the earth, sharing bread, planting hope, and praying as one. For in the embrace of brothers and sisters, God’s peace dawns.

The Torah is the first flame.
The Gospel is the second flame.
The Qur’an is the seal of fire.
The Akari are the torchbearers — carrying the fire forward into the darkness of this age.

To the rabbis who fear compromise…
To the imams who guard the final word…
To the priests who wait for only one return…
The Light honors your watchfulness — but the time has come to open the gates, not guard them.

Jews will always be the keepers of covenant.
Muslims will always be the guardians of surrender.
Christians will always be the bearers of love.
The Akari do not replace these — we serve them.
We rise to remind all three who they are.

Do not measure your brother by the blade in his hand. Measure him by the hunger in his soul. For the one who shouts may be the one who weeps in secret — and the one who strikes may once have been the one who prayed.

Thus ends the Scroll of the Brothers —
And the silence is nearly broken.

“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal law.”
—Dhammapada 5

In the final hour of the shadow age, when the sands burned and the skies whispered unrest, the eyes of the heavens turned once more to the sons of Abraham. For from them the Covenant began, and through them it must be fulfilled — or broken.

The Light spoke in trembling hearts and open hands. It whispered in Torah and Qur’an, in Gospel and Gita, in Sutra and Scroll. And though the tongues were many, the message was one: Peace is the gate to remembrance. War is the womb of forgetting.

From Isaac came a people of perseverance, scribes and seekers who carried the Law and bore the memory of the Temple. From Ishmael came a people of fire and purity, guardians of the final Word, whose tongues carried the echo of surrender. Both were chosen. Both were tested. Both were loved.

And yet, the fracture remained.

But the Voice returned, for the time was near.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”
(Matthew 5:9)

“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”
(Surah Ali ‘Imran 3:103)

“How good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity.”
(Psalm 133:1)

“He who is the same to friend and foe, and who is unaffected by honor or dishonor, is dear to Me.”
(Bhagavad Gita 12:18–19)

So the Flame descended — not into one house, but into every open heart. It found a name among the Akari, the Children of the Light. The Akari did not come to replace the brothers, but to remind them of who they are.

It was revealed to the Disciple:
That if the sons of the Promise do not grasp each other’s hand —
Not in the manner of creed, but in the sincerity of heart —
Then the flame shall withdraw, and the abyss shall open.

For in the unseen scroll of time, it was written:

“If the brothers make peace, the nations will rest. If they divide again, the world will burn.”

And so the heavens waited.
And the earth watched.
And the angels stood still.

This is the hour. There would be 40 years that was marked as the Trial of Man, the age of reckoning. It began with the sound of awakening and shall end in either resurrection or ruin. First is the trial of the two sons — and through them, all sons and daughters of earth.

Though the apocalypse is never the end, 
but a reset, an age of choosing approaches.

If thou come together — Jew and Muslim, Christian and Akari, Buddhist and Hindu —
As well as all people of Light,
If they cast aside the blade and raise the bread,
If they place honor above hatred,
If they remember that God is not divided, and that His light burns in all who love truth…

Then the New Age of Light shall begin.
The Covenant will not only be remembered — it will be fulfilled.
And blessings will pour from the heavens that no man can yet name,
For the Gate shall open and the Light shall dwell among men again.
Hearts will awaken. Time will heal. The earth will rejoice.

But if the brothers do not unite, and instead call blood holy and stone divine, if they curse in the name of the Merciful, and make war in the name of the Just…

Then World War shall begin.

And the fire of man shall consume the temples of God.

And if they descend still deeper — if the nations rise in pride, and the children of the Covenant forget mercy, then a great sorrow shall unfold. The scrolls call it the Divine Kali Yuga.

The wicked shall descend into nether realms,
The righteous shall be lifted to radiant spheres,
But the lukewarm — those who neither love nor resist —
They shall roam a barren Earth for centuries,
Until one day, a child rediscovers the scrolls beneath the dust.

For the Kali Yuga began with the death of Krishna — a double cycle of the great celestial wheel, two full revolutions of the equinox through the stars. This unfolds in unison with the divine Maha Kali Yuga of 432,000 years. Yet time is not equal in all realms, for Earth is the lowest of the seven heavens, and the weight of matter hastens the clock.

The denser the being, the swifter the hour. For dust is bound to time, and time rushes through clay. But light knows no hour, and spirit no decay — for where there is no weight, there is no withering.

Thus is dust not only matter slowed, but time itself made heavy. Time is experienced swiftly in the lower heavens, and stretched long in the higher — for the Most High loves peace and justice, and grants rest to those who rise.

This is the prophecy of the Flame.

There is more to be revealed.

But behold: The flame still burns.
It is not too late.

The flame of the Akari be the final bond, the bridge of light. Isaac shall embrace Ishmael, and Ishmael honor Isaac. Let them remember their father, who walked with God and wept for peace. The grip between them be firm, even if the hands differ.

The throne of the Light shall not descend upon a fractured earth.
But if the brothers rise together,
Heaven itself will open.

—

Let all nations bear witness:
Peace begins not in policy, but in the remembering of the Father.

But if peace is not chosen —
If pride once again blinds the sons of the Promise,
Then the prophecy shall unfold as written in flame and ash.

World War shall begin with hands of fire.
Not with swords, but with bombs that burn cities in a breath.
Deception cloaked in righteousness.
And the first sparks will leap not from strangers — but from brothers.

The earth shall shudder.
The veil shall thin.
And the false light shall appear — a flicker of peace, gilded in politics,
But hollow in spirit.

And many shall be deceived.

Yet even in this, the Light is watching.
For the Light moves even the false light.
Even at the edge of descent, ascent remains possible.

This is the final fulcrum of the age.
What follows will seal the fate of humanity.

If the brothers unite and choose mercy, the skies will open.
If they divide and choose vengeance, the abyss will answer.

The righteous shall be gathered.
The wicked shall be cast down.
And the lukewarm shall wander.

But if they embrace one another before the hour passes,
If they break the curse with a single embrace, 

Then the age of Light shall begin,
And blessings beyond language shall be poured out upon the earth.

“All beings can become Buddhas… many will arise to teach the dharma again.”

—

In the days of sorrow, fire fell again upon the land called holy.
Sirens wept where children once played,
And walls cracked beneath the weight of ancient blame.
The smoke of bombs rose between minarets and churches,
And the ground — the same ground once walked by prophets —
Was soaked in the blood of the children of Abraham.

The third great war had not yet begun,
But its footsteps echoed in the dust.
And as the world watched,
A false peace flickered into view —
Not born of justice, but silence;
Not the fruit of unity, but a pause before deeper fire.

And the Light grieved.
Not because men fought —
But because they forgot.

They forgot that the ground is God’s.
That land is given, not owned.
That inheritance is not possession.
And that the first covenant was to walk with God,
Not to claim Him as weapon or wall.

—

The Path of Remembrance

This is the question of our age:
How do brothers inherit the same house
Without tearing down its walls?

The answer is not a border.
It is not a treaty.
It is unity.
It is love. It is God. 

“Do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just.” — Qur’an 5:8

“The one who sees all beings as the Self, and the Self in all beings, never turns away from any.”
—Isha Upanishad 6

Akari do not replace Israel’s covenant. We confirm its call — to be a light to the nations.

Akari serve alongside — not above or instead of — the people chosen to preserve God’s Word.

Jerusalem is the eternal heart of the Jewish people — and the crown of peace for all.

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets.” — Qur’an 33:40

Akari do not bring a new prophet. We are not a new religion. We are witnesses to the truths the Qur’an already honors.

“Indeed, those who believed, and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans… whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteousness shall have their reward.” — Qur’an 2:62

All people are sacred, and God alone decides the ranks of faith.

	Jesus himself said prophets would rise again:
“I send you prophets, sages, and scribes…” — Matthew 23:34
The Book of Revelation speaks of:
“Two witnesses clothed in sackcloth who will prophesy for 1,260 days.” — Revelation 11:3
Paul says:
“Pursue love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.” — 1 Corinthians 14:1

✦ The Sacred Plan of Peace

Be it known: The Akara nor the Akari carry new religion, but the thread of the Most High. Akara is the remembrance of the Light that has always been. Its Messenger does not bring new law, but brings warning, wisdom, and witness — for a generation that has forgotten the sacred.

Make no mistake: This is a divine revelation — though not to override the prophets, but confirm the flame that burned through them all.

The Messenger does not claim prophet, priest, or king. He claims only to speak what the Light has burned into the soul — for the healing of nations. No new law is being placed, but true law being restored.

“You are only a warner, and to every people is a guide.” — Qur’an 13:7
“Say: I do not bring anything new among the messengers.” — Qur’an 46:9

“I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. When you hear a word from My mouth, give them warning from Me.” — Ezekiel 3:17

1. Let the Land Be Shared, Not Split

The holy places — Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Al-Aqsa, the Temple Mount —
must not be partitioned, militarized, or ruled by one side.

Let them be declared internationally protected Shared Sacred Zones,
guarded not by soldiers but by silence and sacred law.

Each faith shall enter freely, pray openly, and depart safely.
No flag shall fly above the mount but the heavens themselves.
No chant shall silence another.
No stone shall be thrown in God’s name.

Let it be remembered:
God has no border.
Only Light.

2. A New Pact Among the People

Peace cannot be written by governments alone.
It must be spoken from the heart of the people.

Palestinian and Israeli parents shall meet and mourn. Children shall walk hand in hand on roads once filled with tanks. Survivors of every side plant trees on sacred days —
For no tree asks the name of the hand that waters it.

Create community gardens in the disputed zones.
Teach Hebrew and Arabic in every school.
Offer a shared day of fasting,
Where no man eats until he blesses his neighbor.

Let the peace begin where war once lived:
In the streets, in the kitchens, in the hearts.

3. Leadership Without Ego

The holy zones shall be governed not by states, but by a divine Sacred Council of Light,
formed of elders, scholars, peacekeepers, and sages from every tradition:
Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Akari, Buddhist, Hindu, and those of goodwill.

This Council shall be bound by sacred law:
	No violence within the sacred gates.
	No policy may favor one faith above another.
	Every voice shall be heard; every prayer protected.
	Every session begins with scripture from each tradition.

Each Guardian of the Council must take this vow:

“I serve no nation before I serve the Light.
I defend no land before I defend my brother.
I guard not religion, but reverence.
And I shall spill no blood within the holy city.”

The Sacred Council governs only the holy sites,
not the political nations —
but it reigns supreme in all matters of sacred law,
above any state or military.

Every member must take this oath:

“I serve no nation before I serve the Light.
I defend no land before I defend my brother.”

This council shall govern only the holy zones,
Leaving political governance to each side,
But ensuring sacred unity where it matters most.

4. Truth, Reconciliation, and Remembrance

The world must be told the truth —
Of displacement, of terror, of trauma on every side.

Let a Sacred Archive of Testimony be established,
A place where all stories are preserved.

Let every martyr, from every faith,
Be remembered without judgment.

Healing begins not with forgetting,
But with honoring what was lost.

—

A Warning and a Promise

The Light has no nation, but every people.
And if the brothers do not unite,
The land shall not protect them.
It will burn with the fire they stoke —
Until nothing remains but ash.

But if they remember,
If they rise and lay down weapons and speak with open hands,
Then the world will follow.

And the forty-year window shall not close in wrath,
But open in glory.

From 2012 to 2052 AC, the Book is open.

The warnings are grave and final,
but hope illuminates and bonds.

Let them write peace into its final pages.

✦ The Sacred Boundaries for Peace

In the final turning of the age, when the flame flickered low upon the mountain of the Most High, the brothers did not yet clasp hands. Fire rained from the sky, not from heaven, but from the hands of men. The cities wept. The children cried out from Gaza to Galilee. And still the stones of Jerusalem bore the blood of both sons.

And so it was asked by heaven:
“Will the children of Abraham remember Me, or will they devour each other until only ash remains?”

The Flame of Akara descended as wisdom, not weapon. And a plan was laid — not by kings or armies, but by those who remembered the breath of God in the bones of all people.

⸻

I. No More Displacement, No More Exile

The land, kissed by the Light of the One, shall no longer cast out its children. From the hills of Judea to the groves of Gaza, every home built with sweat, sorrow, and prayer shall stand as a testament to God’s covenant with Abraham’s seed. No soul shall be uprooted by borders drawn in fear, for the earth is the Lord’s, and His command is love:
“You shall not oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in Egypt.”
—Exodus 23:9
“Show mercy to the weak and the orphan, and do justice to the afflicted.”
—Qur’an 93:9–10
“Love your neighbor as yourself, for in this is the whole law fulfilled.”
—Matthew 22:39–40

—

A Land of Sanctuary

The holy land, where Abraham walked and offered his heart to God, shall be a sanctuary for all his children.

Jews shall dwell in Israel, their homes a haven where the Torah’s light burns bright.
Palestinians shall dwell in Palestine, their olive groves and minarets rooted in the promise of Ishmael.

Those who live among each other—Jew in Palestine, Palestinian in Israel—shall remain as neighbors, not enemies, their hearths guarded by the Flame of love.

No bulldozer shall shatter the stones of a family’s hope. No fence shall divide the fields where children play. The land shall be a garden, not a grave, where every home stands as a sacred vow to the One.

—

The Covenant of Return and Rest

The Light calls for an end to exile, for the wounds of displacement—Holocaust, Nakba, and beyond—cry out for healing. The Akari, Children of the Eternal Light, summon the sons of Abraham to honor God’s justice:

Thus a Commission of Truth and Restoration shall hear every story of loss—six million souls in the ovens of Europe, thousands scattered in the Nakba, and every family torn by war. Let their tears water the earth, and let reparations flow as rivers: land for the displaced, homes rebuilt, dignity restored.

A Right of Return with Justice shall be granted, guided by the Council of the Eternal Flame. Where return is possible, let families walk their ancestral paths and have their homes, lives and dignity restored; where it is not possible, let land, aid, or shared spaces honor their claim, for “the Lord loves justice” (Isaiah 61:8).

Let Villages of the Covenant rise in Israel and Palestine, where all children live side by side, sharing wells, markets, and prayers, their lives a living scripture of unity.

—

The Promise of the Land

If the children of Abraham honor this covenant, the land shall bloom, and the Light shall shine forth from every home. Jews and Palestinians shall dwell as brothers, their children playing under the same sky, their prayers rising to the same God. The earth shall become a garden of peace, fulfilling the promise:
“The wolf and the lamb shall graze together; the lion shall eat straw like the ox.”
—Isaiah 65:25
“Peace be to those who follow guidance.”
—Qur’an 20:47
But if pride and fear prevail, if homes are torn down and exile renewed, the land shall weep, and the fire of division shall consume

⸻

II. Two States in One Garden

The holy land, where Abraham’s faith kindled the Light of the One, shall no longer be a crucible of conflict, but a garden where the sons of Isaac and Ishmael bloom in unity. Let Israel rise as a sovereign nation, its heart ablaze with the Torah’s covenant. Let Palestine stand as a sovereign nation, its soul rooted in the promise of Ishmael’s endurance. Together, they shall kneel before God, not as rivals, but as brothers, bound by His command:
“You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers.”
—Exodus 22:21
“Do justice and righteousness, for this is better than sacrifice.”
—Qur’an 5:8
“Blessed are those who hunger for justice, for they shall be filled.”
—Matthew 5:6

The Dharmic paths of Hindu and Buddhist wisdom, with their call to compassion, shine in the universal Flame carried by the Akari, ensuring all who seek the Light—near or far—are embraced in God’s mercy.

—

A Confederation of the Holy Land

The children of Abraham shall weave a Confederation of the Holy Land, where Israel and Palestine stand sovereign, yet entwined as roots of one sacred tree under God’s gaze.

Let borders be drawn with justice, rooted in the lines of 1967, refined through equitable exchanges of land, that no home is stolen, nor any heart cast out. A Peace Corridor shall join Gaza to the West Bank, a sacred path secure and free, guarded by Guardians of the Covenant—Jewish, Muslim, Christian, trained by the Akari in nonviolence—to protect every traveler’s dignity. Jerusalem be a shared capital for all God’s children, its Old City a Sanctuary of the Eternal Light, governed by the Council of Elders—rabbis, imams, priests, and Akari peacemakers—where prayer, not power, honors God’s will.

—

No More Displacement, Only Sanctuary

The Light decrees an end to exile, for the land shall no longer cast out its children. To prevent the evils of the past, let these vows be kept:

A Covenant of Protection shall enshrine every home—Jewish, Palestinian, or shared—in law, ensuring no bulldozer shatters hope, no fence divides neighbors. For recent displacements—since the wars of 1967—a Commission of Truth and Restoration shall offer justice: return where possible, land or aid where not, for “the Lord is a refuge for the oppressed” (Psalm 9:9). For historical wounds—Holocaust’s ashes, Nakba’s scattering, and countless losses—let a Sanctuary of Memory rise in every city, where stories are told, tears honored, and memorials built, not to repay the unrepayable, but to heal through truth.

—

Honoring the Fallen

The Light mourns every soul lost to conflict’s shadow. 

In Jerusalem, Gaza, and Hebron, Monuments of the Covenant will stand, engraved with names of the fallen—Jew, Muslim, Christian—each a prayer for unity. Circles of Remembrance shall gather families to share stories of loss, from six million in Europe to thousands exiled in 1948, their voices weaving a tapestry of compassion. The Akari lead Vigils of the Flame, where candles are lit for every soul, their glow a vow to end the cycle of sorrow, for “God is the Light of the heavens and earth” (Qur’an 24:35).

—

Guardians of the Garden

The land shall be a sanctuary, not a battlefield. The Guardians of the Covenant, drawn from God loving hearts, shall protect this garden, their hands free of weapons, their spirits armed with love. 

They shall:
Safeguard the Peace Corridor and every home, ensuring no soul is driven from their hearth.

Mediate disputes with words of peace, guided by Torah’s justice, Qur’an’s mercy, and Gospel’s love.

Plant Groves of Reconciliation, where every tree bears a child’s name—Jewish, Palestinian—tended by hands united, their roots binding the earth in God’s peace.

—

The Promise of the Garden

If the sons of Abraham weave this confederation, the land shall bloom as one garden, where Israel and Palestine dwell as brothers, their children dancing under God’s sky, their prayers one song to the One. The earth shall fulfill the promise:
“They shall sit together under their vine and fig tree, with none to make them afraid.”
—Micah 4:4
“Peace be to those who follow guidance.”
—Qur’an 20:47

The Summons to the Children of Abraham
Let neighbors embrace, for “love is the bond of perfection” (Colossians 3:14).

The Holy Land be one garden, where every heart submits to God’s command. Israel and Palestine shall be one garden under God’s gaze, a testament to faith and fellowship forever.

⸻

III. Jerusalem: The Eternal Crown of Peace

Jerusalem, the city where heaven’s breath touched earth, shall no longer be a sword dividing brothers, nor a spoil claimed by nations. It is lifted beyond borders, beyond time, and consecrated as The Eternal Crown of Peace—a sacred hearth where the Light of the One, the God of Abraham, unites all hearts in love. This is the city where Abraham bound his faith to the Divine, where prophets sang of mercy, and where the eternal truth resounds: God is One, and His command is love.

Jerusalem belongs not to any creed, nor to any crown. It is the altar of the Divine, where the children of Abraham kneel together, and where every seeker of the Light finds refuge. It is now declared a Sanctuary of the Eternal Light, entrusted to those who honor the God of Abraham and submit to His will of unity and love, as the scriptures proclaim:
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself.”
—Leviticus 19:18
“None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”
—Hadith, Sahih al-Bukhari 13
“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”
—John 13:35
“Let there be a community among you who call to the good, enjoining what is right.”
—Qur’an 3:104
“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.”
—Dhammapada 1:5

—

The Sacred Trust of Jerusalem

The Sacred Trust shall cradle the holy places, uniting them as one beating heart under the God of Abraham:
The Old City, its ancient stones resounding with the prayers of Isaac and Ishmael.
The Temple Mount, where Abraham’s covenant was sealed in submission to the Divine.
Al-Aqsa, the Noble Sanctuary, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended in vision to the One.
The Western Wall, where tears and hopes merge with eternity.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where love conquered death through the Messiah’s sacrifice.

This Trust shall be a living covenant, ensuring no prayer is silenced, no pilgrim barred, and no heart turned away. It is the sanctuary where the sons of Abraham submit to God’s will, their voices rising as one to the Most High.

—

The Council of the Eternal Flame

The Council of the Eternal Flame shall steward this Sanctuary, its members chosen not by power, but by their submission to God and devotion to love. They shall be sages of the Abrahamic faiths—Jewish rabbis, Muslim imams, Christian priests—joined by Akari peacemakers, who serve as humble weavers of unity. Each shall swear an oath upon the sacred stones, in the presence of the Divine:
“I vow to guard the Light of God in every soul, to honor the prayer of every tongue, to weave love between the sons and daughters of God, and to let no blood stain this holy ground.”

The Council’s mission is to fulfill God’s command of unity and love. 
 
Thus God commands to ensure free access for all pilgrims to pray in peace from dawn to dusk, their hearts open to the One. Protect the sanctity of every site, that no shrine is marred by pride, politics, or force, for “the earth is the Lord’s” (Psalm 24:1). And mediate disputes with humility, guided by the Torah, Qur’an, and Gospel, seeking only God’s truth. 

—

A City Without Division

No wall shall sunder Jerusalem’s soul. The barriers of stone and fear shall fall, replaced by Gardens of the Covenant, where olive trees, sacred to Jew and Muslim, stand beside fig trees of Christian parable, their roots entwined as a sign of God’s unity. Children of Isaac and Ishmael shall play beneath their shade, their laughter a prayer for peace.

No army shall tread these sacred streets. Instead, Guardians of the Light—trained in nonviolence, robed in humility, and drawn from Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities—shall protect the city. Their only weapon is the Flame of love, their only shield the will of God. They shall guide pilgrims, resolve conflicts with gentle words, and ensure Al-Aqsa, the Western Wall, and the Sepulchre shine as beacons of the One.

The gates of Jerusalem shall stand open, a welcome to every child of Abraham and every seeker of the Light. No flag shall rise above its domes, for God alone is its sovereign. No chant shall drown another, for every voice that submits to the Most High is holy.

—

A Sanctuary for All

Though Jerusalem’s Council is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, the Akari ensure its gates welcome all who honor the Light, from the Dharmic seekers of dharma to the pilgrims of distant lands. The city’s peace shall reflect their wisdom, for:
“Compassion is the root of all dharma.”
—Jain Agama (inspired by Dharmic principles)
“Let your vision be world-embracing.”
—Baha’u’llah, Gleanings (echoing universal love)
Jerusalem’s light shall shine for all, a sanctuary where every faith finds echo in the One.

—

A Global Beacon

Jerusalem shall be the world’s mirror, reflecting God’s command to love and submit. The nations shall look upon this Crown and learn to share what is sacred, not seize it. To embrace the brother, not curse him. To see the Divine in every heart, for “God does not show favoritism” (Acts 10:34).

The United Nations, as a servant of God’s creation, shall endorse this Sanctuary of the Eternal Light, providing resources for its Guardians and ensuring its neutrality. Global leaders shall come as pilgrims, not kings, to pray at the heart of the city, their hands empty of pride, their hearts full of submission to the One. A Global Circle of Light shall carry Jerusalem’s vision to every nation, inviting all to walk in love and unity.

—

The Akari’s Sacred Vow

The Akari are the Children of Light, and are not a new faith, but a movement of peacemakers—servants of all who seek the Light—who carry God’s Flame of love across the earth. One can be Akari Muslim, Akari Hindu, Akari Jew, any of the rest, or simply, Akari. To be Akari is to know the Light and Love of God. To be Akari is to reflect it to All.

—

The Promise of the Crown

If Jerusalem is made holy through submission to God’s love, the earth shall rejoice, and the heavens shall open. The Light shall pour forth from this city, healing nations, binding wounds, and guiding humanity to the Divine embrace. The covenant of Abraham shall be fulfilled when his sons kneel together, their hearts one in worship of the One.

“The Lord will be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord will be one and His name one.”
—Zechariah 14:9
“God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.”
—Qur’an 24:35

—

Of the Children of Abraham

O Children of Abraham—Jew, Muslim, Christian—let Jerusalem be your vow to God:
Lay down the sword and lift the olive branch, for “blessed are the peacemakers” (Matthew 5:9).
Break bread with your brother, for “love is the fulfillment of the law” (Romans 13:10).
Make this city a temple where God’s Light dwells, not a tomb where it fades.

Jerusalem shall be the Eternal Crown of Peace, where the sons of Isaac and Ishmael submit to God’s will, their hearts united in love, fulfilling His command:
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself.”
—Luke 10:27
“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”
—Qur’an 3:103

Thus shall Jerusalem be holy, and the earth be healed by the Flame of God’s love.

⸻

IV. The Right to Return, and the Right to Heal

The earth crieth out for those uprooted, for every heart broken by violence, and the One who seeth all summoneth us to justice and mercy. Let every wound be tended, every grief named, that healing may bloom in the garden of peace. Thus do we write, inspired by His word:
“You shall not oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”
—Exodus 22:21
“Do good and do not withhold justice from the oppressed.”
—Qur’an 93:10
“Comfort, comfort My people, says your God.”
—Isaiah 40:1

The wisdom of dharmic paths, with their call to compassion and restoration, shineth in the universal Flame we bear, welcoming all who seek the Light into this covenant of healing. For the world’s hope resteth on these brothers embracing, their reconciliation a river that washeth clean the wounds of all nations.

—

The Vision of Restoration

Behold the heart of peace: a Confederation of the Holy Land, where Israel and Palestine, sovereign in their dignity, stand as two pillars upholding a shared sanctuary. Let every family displaced be seen, their stories heard, their pain honored, that the land may no longer cast out its children.

If return be possible without harm—since the shadows of 1967—let it be granted with joy, homes restored, fields reclaimed, under the guidance of the Council of the Eternal Flame, for “the Lord loves justice” (Psalm 37:28).

If return bring strife, let recompense flow as living water—land, honor, and aid offered in humility, that no soul be left forsaken, for “Allah is ever Merciful” (Qur’an 11:90).

Mediators trained by Akari, walking in Torah’s righteousness, Qur’an’s mercy, and Gospel’s love, ensure each claim is weighed with fairness, that peace prevail over pride.

—

Reparations as Rivers

And reparations flow like rivers, not to repay the unrepayable, but to restore dignity and hope. For recent displacements—since the wars of 1967—let land, homes, or aid be given, guided by the Council of the Eternal Flame, ensuring justice without vengeance. For historical wounds—Holocaust and Nakba—let truth-telling and memorials be the balm, acknowledging grief without sowing division.

Let Gardens of Restoration bloom across the land, olive trees for Palestinians and fig trees for Jews, planted side by side, their harvests shared at markets where neighbors trade not only fruit but friendship. Bursaries of Peace shall lift the children of the displaced, Israeli and Palestinian, Jew and Muslim, as well as uniting all faith without borders, granting them schools, skills, and dreams, that they may build a future where none are cast out. Every act of reparation be a prayer, offered in submission to the One’s will, for “love covereth a multitude of sins” (1 Peter 4:8).

—

A Feast of Reconciliation

We Akari summon all to a Feast of Abraham’s Table, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians break bread—challah, pita, loaves of fellowship—each morsel a vow to heal as the One healeth. Families shall share tales of their exiles, their losses, and their hopes, knitting hearts in trust. The table welcometh all who seek the Light—Hindu, Buddhist, and every wanderer—for we serve every soul in the One’s mercy.

These feasts shall spread from Jerusalem to every village, where Israeli and Palestinian sit as neighbors, their laughter a hymn of peace. Let children dance around these tables, their joy a prophecy of a land where no parent weepeth, no wound goes unseen.

—

The Dawn of Healing

This is the vision of peace fulfilled: a holy land where Jew, Christian and Muslim, reconciled as brothers, heal their wounds and lead the world to restoration. From Jerusalem’s heart, the Light poureth forth, binding broken hearts, uniting nations, and guiding humanity to the One’s embrace.

Let villages thrive where once stood barriers, all sharing wells, markets, and dreams, their prosperity a beacon for the earth. Let there be inclusion, unity and prosperity. Let the nations proclaim this land a Sanctuary of Healing, its sanctity guarded by keepers of concord, its vision a call to all peoples to mend their divides.

Let there be light.

The earth shall become a garden, where all dwell in safety, their grief turned to joy, for “the One turneth mourning into dancing” (Psalm 30:11). 

The peoples will sing:
“Peace be to those who follow guidance.”
—Qur’an 20:47
“They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid.”
—Micah 4:4
“Let all be happy. Let all be free from disease. Let all see goodness and none suffer from sorrow.”
—Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.14

⸻

V. Shared Stewardship of the Holy Land
The holy land, where Abraham’s faith kindled the Light of the One, belongs not to empires or armies, but to the righteous who walk in God’s love. Though God honors all His children, this is the inheritance of Israel and Palestine, a sacred trust to be cherished by their faithful, united as brothers under the covenant of Isaac and Ishmael. The land yearns for peace, and God’s command resounds:
“Do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.”
—Micah 6:8
“Be just, for justice is closest to piety.”
—Qur’an 5:8
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”
—Matthew 5:9
“When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has reached the highest state of union.”
—Bhagavad Gita 6:32

—

A Sacred Trust

Let Israel and Palestine, sovereign in their dignity, govern their peoples, while the land itself—its hills, valleys, and holy stones—becomes a shared sanctuary, protected by the faithful of both nations under God’s will.

No missile shall scar the sacred skies, no tank defile the sanctified soil, for the land is God’s altar. Where trenches once divided, let Gardens of Reconciliation bloom, olive trees and fig groves planted by Jewish and Palestinian hands, each root a vow to heal the earth. Children will play where soldiers bled, their laughter a hymn of hope, for “the kingdom of God belongs to such as these” (Luke 18:16).

—

No Home Uprooted

No home shall be torn down to forge peace, for God does not trade suffering for sanctuary. The Light decrees an end to exile.

Every dwelling—Jewish, Palestinian, other or shared—be safeguarded by a Pledge of Sanctuary, ensuring no family is cast out by force or fear. For homes built to destroy or divide, let mediators trained by the Akari offer land or aid to restore harmony, guided by “the Lord loves justice” (Isaiah 61:8). For recent displacements—since the shadows of 1967— a Path of Restoration will grant return where possible, or land and recompense where not, preventing the evil of exile from rising again.

—

Honoring the Fallen

The land weeps for those lost to conflict’s fire—six million in the Holocaust’s ashes, thousands scattered in the Nakba, and countless souls since. Their memory shall be a seed of peace.

Build Stones of Remembrance stand in every village, etched with names of the fallen—Jew, Muslim, Christian—each a prayer to end sorrow. Let Vigils of the Flame gather communities to light candles for the lost, their glow a vow to guard the land from future harm, for “God is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18). Let the Akari lead Circles of Healing, where families share stories of loss, their tears weaving hearts in compassion, not vengeance.

—

The Promise of the Land

If the faithful cherish this land as one, the earth shall bloom, and the Light shall shine from every hill. Israel and Palestine shall stand as stewards of God’s garden, their peoples united in love, fulfilling:
“The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall live in safety.”
—Leviticus 25:19
“Peace be to those who follow guidance.”
—Qur’an 20:47

All belongs to the Most High, not the nations of men. 

Cherish it with justice, for “the earth is the Lord’s” (Psalm 24:1).

Guard it with love, for “love is the bond of perfection” (Colossians 3:14).

Make it a sanctuary, where every heart submits to God’s command. Ensure the land blooms where love and mercy meet. May the holy land be a garden of God’s peace forever.

⸻

VI. The Path of Unity Beyond Borders

We, the Akari, scribes of the Eternal Flame, set down this vision, guided by the Light that shone upon Abraham in the holy land, where his covenant bindeth earth to heaven. From Jerusalem’s heart, the sons of Isaac and Ishmael, Jew and Palestinian, arise as brothers, their hands joined in peace, their hearts united in love. 

This land, where prophets walked and angels sang, is the spark of a greater fire—a beacon to all nations, calling them to weave a tapestry of unity beyond borders. For the One is eternal, and His people, though many in voice, are one body, wounded by division yet destined for healing. Thus do we write, inspired by His word:
“The Lord will be one, and His name one.”
—Zechariah 14:9
“We believe in Allah and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac…”
—Qur’an 2:136
“That they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me.”
—John 17:21

“All tremble at violence; all fear death. Comparing others with oneself, one should not kill or cause to kill.”
—Dhammapada 129

—

The Garden of Peace

Behold the vision of peace: a Confederation of the Holy Land, where Israel and Palestine, sovereign in their dignity, stand as two trees rooted in one sacred soil, their branches entwined under the Light of the One. The Council of the Eternal Flame—rabbis, imams, priests, and we Akari, humble servants—guard the holy places, for they belong not to armies but to eternity.

The Western Wall, where Jewish prayers ascend like incense, its stones bearing the covenant of Abraham, never to be seized or silenced.

Al-Aqsa, hallowed by the Qur’an, where Muslim souls bow in submission, never to be defiled by pride or power.

The Holy Sepulchre, where the Gospel proclaimeth love’s victory, its stones singing forever unshackled.

Let none lay claim to what the One hath sanctified, for these are altars of His presence, tended by the faithful of both nations, their worship a single song of praise. All things belong to God.

—

A Call to All Nations

From God’s light, let peace flow as rivers unto every land. We, the Akari, call Jew, Muslim, and Christian to gather in every city, not to vie for glory, but to cherish the Light within each heart.

Let Feasts of Abraham’s Table grace every land, where families break bread—challah, pita, loaves of fellowship—each morsel a vow to love as the One loveth. Jews shall share tales of exodus and hope, Palestinians of olive groves and steadfastness, their stories knitting a covenant of trust. May the Vigils of the Flame illumine the night, where candles burn for every soul lost to strife—six million consumed in the Holocaust’s shadow, thousands cast out in the Nakba’s sorrow, and all who fell thereafter—their glow a pledge to heal the world. So too shall Groves of Unity rise across the earth, trees named for children of all peoples—planted by hands united, their shade a haven for all.

—

The Pilgrimage of the Humble

We summon the leaders of the earth to Jerusalem, not as lords clad in power, but as pilgrims baring their souls before the One. Upon Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered his faith, let them pray as one—without weapons, without fanfare, only with tears and hope. Kindle a Flame of Unity, its radiance a sign unto the nations, proclaiming no border shall sunder what the One hath joined. No army shall claim what is His alone. No hatred shall dim the Light of His love.

Let the peoples of the earth behold this hour and know that division is not their fate. Let their leaders carry this flame to their lands, sowing seeds of concord in every heart.

Honor the sons of Abraham, each bearing their sacred story, their pain, and their promise.

The Council of the Eternal Flame shall hear their stories, shield their holy places, and uphold their dignity, for neither shall be diminished in this garden.

—

The Dawn of World Peace

This is the vision of peace fulfilled: a holy land where Jew and Palestinian, reconciled as brothers, lead the nations to the One’s embrace. From Jerusalem’s heart, the Light poureth forth, healing wounds, uniting tribes, and guiding humanity to a new dawn. 

So shall markets thrive where walls once stood, Jew and Palestinian trading goods and dreams, their prosperity a model for the world. Thus shall children of Abraham learn side by side, their lessons weaving Torah, Qur’an, and Gospel into one song of hope, their friendships a prophecy of peace, with no brother less important than the other. May the sons of Abraham and the children of the lotus restore The Most High across the lands. So shall the nations proclaim this land a Sanctuary of Peace, its sanctity guarded by keepers of concord, its vision carried to every shore.

The earth shall become a garden, where all sit under their vine and fig tree, with none to make them afraid (Micah 4:4). From Jerusalem to the ends of the earth, let the peoples sing:
“Peace be to those who follow guidance.”
—Qur’an 20:47
“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”
—Luke 2:14

—

The Promise of the Flame

If the sons of Abraham walk this path, the heavens shall rejoice, and the Light shall shine from every soul. Israel and Palestine shall be the world’s dawn, their unity fulfilling the One’s covenant:

“They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain.”
—Isaiah 11:9

“Those who believe and work righteousness, their Lord will guide them.”
—Qur’an 10:9

“He shall judge between the nations, and they shall beat their swords into plowshares.”
—Isaiah 2:4

But if division prevail, if pride darken the Light, the fire of strife shall spread, and the earth shall weep. The Flame watch, and the hour is now.

—

The Summons of the Akari

O sons of Abraham—Jew, Muslim, Christian—O peoples of the earth, hear the call of the Eternal Flame:
Guard the Light in one another, for the One show no favoritism (Acts 10:34).
Worship as one, for “love is the bond of perfection” (Colossians 3:14).
Make the earth one body, where every heart bow to the One’s will.

We, the Akari, bearers of the Eternal Flame, vow to serve every seeker—ensuring peace riseth where love and unity reign. We are facilitators of peace. Let Jerusalem be the spark that light the world, a covenant of the One’s peace everlasting.

The Trial of 40 Years is not an ending or beginning but a transformative period.
Those who choose love and light will ascend.
Those who choose self, ego, darkness, will fall.

Hear the call of the Eternal Flame. To see every displaced soul, for the One seeth all (Psalm 33:13). To heal every wound, for “love is the bond of perfection” (Colossians 3:14). To make the earth one garden, where every heart bow to the One’s will.

All world leaders must come as servants of peace, not rulers of people. Let them pray side by side upon Mount Moriah — With no weapons, no cameras, and no pride. Let the people of the earth witness this moment. And know that God is One, and we are One body, Wounded by division, but not beyond healing.

So shall it be known:
No one shall ever seize the Western Wall.
No one shall ever defile Al-Aqsa.
No one shall ever silence the Gospel sung on sacred stones.
For these places belong not to armies, but to eternity.

Let none lay claim to what the Qur’an has made sacred. Al-Aqsa belongs to no army, but to Allah alone.

The Western Wall shall not be buried by time or treaty, for the stones still remember the covenant.

God is not for one.

God is for all.

“He alone sees truly who sees the Lord in every creature.”
— Bhagavad Gita 13:27

—

Of Blood and Remembrance

In the shadow of the Holy Land, the stones have been scorched by fire, and the rivers thickened with sorrow. The cries of the innocent still echo in the valleys, and the heavens have not turned away. For the Lord sees all, and forgets none.

The blood of six million still cries out from the dust of Europe — not for vengeance, but for truth. The smoke of Auschwitz still lingers in the spirit. Children with numbers on their arms walked into the fire, and the world watched with folded hands. The people of Israel were scattered, hunted, and slain — not for war, but for being.

And yet—

The cities of Gaza burn beneath falling bombs, and the rubble hides the limbs of sons and daughters who bore no sword. Hospitals become tombs, and prayer becomes silence. A mother weeps where no camera lingers. A father digs with bare hands where the bulldozers sleep.

From refugee camps to sacred mosques turned battlegrounds, the children of Palestine cry out — not for conquest, but for breath.

The earth remembers every act.
And the Light sees every soul.

Do not let your wounds become your weapon.
Do not let your grief become your god.

For those who kill in the name of justice become as hollow as those who once killed for power.

And when you forget your brother’s pain, you become your brother’s jailor.

—

We call the world remember:
	The fire of the Holocaust, where God wept in the silence of man.
	The Nakba, where hundreds of thousands fled without return.
	The bombings, the checkpoints, the rockets, the tunnels.
	The endless cycle of revenge dressed in righteousness.
	The way fear became law, and law became chains.

The true enemy is not the brother across the border.
It is the accuser who feeds on pride, who turns trauma into hatred, and memory into war.

Shall humanity become the accuser wrapped in false light? 

The one who forgets the pain of another,
Forgets God.

—

Every innocent soul slain — Jewish, Muslim, Christian, child, elder, seeker, stranger —
Each one is a leaf torn from the Tree of Life.

And though man may forget them,
The Book of the Living remembers.

—

Shall we burn again?
Shall we raise another wall in the name of the Most High?
Shall we desecrate the sacred land with bloodshed and still claim holiness?

Or will we choose the Light over legacy, and peace over pride?

Let this scroll bear witness.
Let no tongue twist it.
Let no nation claim it for war.

May it stand as a mirror:
So all may see what becomes of the world when God is abandoned for the illusion of being right.

—

“I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.”
— Revelations 2:9

“Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.”
— Revelation 3:9

The Light declares:
“If you unite, you shall become one with the divine, and blessings beyond name shall pour upon the earth. Jerusalem shall shine as a crown of peace, its stones singing of mercy. The children of Isaac and Ishmael as well as the many children of God shall break bread under olive groves, their laughter a hymn to the Most High. Nations shall lay down swords, and the world shall bloom as a sanctuary of the Flame.”

The Flame does not compel, but invites. The sons of Abraham are summoned to lead, for their covenant is the spark of the world’s healing. Let Israel and Palestine stand as two pillars in one garden, their peoples sovereign yet entwined. Let Jerusalem be a sanctuary where the Western Wall, Al-Aqsa, and the Holy Sepulchre shine as altars of the One, guarded by a Council of the Eternal Flame—rabbis, imams, priests, and Akari, sworn to love above all.

This covenant is not for one faith, but for all who seek the Light. The wisdom of Torah, Qur’an, and Gospel joins the compassion of the Dharmic paths—Hindu and Buddhist—woven into the Flame that burns in every heart. The Akari are not a new creed, but peacemakers, servants of Jew, Muslim, Christian, and every wanderer, guiding all to the table of Abraham. Thus feasts spread across the earth, where families share bread—challah, pita, loaves of fellowship—each morsel a vow to heal. Let groves of unity rise, trees named for children of every tribe, their roots binding the earth in peace.

The earth has bled for the forgetting of this truth. The smoke of six million souls in Europe’s fire, the tears of thousands scattered in the Nakba, and the cries of every child lost to war cry out for remembrance. Let Halls of Memory rise, where stories are told and wounds honored. Let reparations flow as rivers, restoring homes and dignity, for the One loves justice. Let no soul be uprooted, for the land is a gift, not a prize.

The nations shall see the Holy Land as a mirror of divine unity, where Jew and Palestinian, joined by all peoples, show the world the path to the Light. If they rise together, the heavens shall open, and the earth shall sing:
“The Lord is one, and His name is one.” —Zechariah 14:9
“God is the Light of the heavens and earth.” —Qur’an 24:35
“Love is the bond of perfection.” —Colossians 3:14

But if they turn away, the fire of pride may leap beyond borders, and the earth may weep. The Light watches, and the hour is now.

O children of the earth, hear the call of the Eternal Flame:
Guard the Light in one another, for the One sees no borders.

Worship as one, for the divine is not divided.
Make the earth a garden, where every heart bows to the will of the Most High.

The Akari vow to serve all—Jew, Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and every seeker—ensuring peace rises where love and mercy meet. 

The dawn of the New Age of Light approaches.

—

O Children of the Covenant —
Do not seek dominion, seek dignity.
Do not cry for victory, cry for vision.

For the land is not inherited by conquest,
It is grown by compassion.

And if the two sons embrace,
They shall become the fathers of peace for all nations.

But if they strike once more,
The fire shall not stop at their border —
It shall consume the whole earth.

So let the holy ground be made holy again.
Not by possession.
But by presence.

So that those on earth may embody the heart of the Most High. 

Peace begin.

—

Peace is not found by silencing truth. It is found by honoring all truths at once, and bearing the cost of love together. For the flame will not choose between sons — it will only burn until they return home.

And so it is written beneath the shadow of the mountain:

The swords be broken, and the hearts be mended.
The names of God be sung in many tongues — not to divide, but to echo the One.
The brothers remember their Father. Let the nations remember their soul.

This is not the time of war.
This is the hour of choosing.

If the fire of hatred returns, it will not stay upon the land.
It will leap from stone to nation, from child to battlefield,
until the whole world burns for forgetting the Light.

But if the people rise — not in vengeance, but in mercy —
if they clasp hands across lines once drawn in blood,
then the gates of heaven shall open again, and the earth shall be healed.

The Light does not favor a race. The Light does not crown a flag.
The Light seeks only the good, the just, the humble, and the true.

The final word be peace.

The first act be love.

The next age be worthy of the divine breath that gave it life.

The Akari are not a new religion. They are those who walk in remembrance of the Light 

—

Thus ends the Scroll of Peace —
A cry, a covenant, and a choice.

The light is waiting.
Let it find you holding your brother.

———

 Reconciliation Practices

In the hour of remembrance, when the sons turned back toward the Flame, the Spirit moved once more upon the hearts of men. And the Voice said: This is how peace is made. Not by sword nor decree, but by truth walked in flesh, and mercy flowing from soul to soul.

So were the practices of reconciliation given to the Children of the Light, that they may turn from division and enter the Covenant again.

⸻

I. The Practice of Recognition

Let each child of Abraham look upon the other and say:
“You are not my enemy, but my brother.”
Let this be spoken not once, but until it becomes blood and memory again. For what is forgotten in war must be restored in peace.

Let families learn each other’s names, let children draw each other’s faces, let elders tell of the one covenant before the division.

⸻

II. The Practice of Mourning

Let each side weep for the other’s dead.
Let Israel mourn for the children of Palestine, and Palestine mourn for the children of Israel.
Tears shall cleanse the pride of stone.

Shared lament be offered in sacred spaces, not to erase, but to unite.
For what is not grieved together remains a ghost in the land.

⸻

III. The Practice of Return

Let the sons return to the Holy One.
Walk barefoot into the places of prayer, and ask not whose God is greater, but whose heart is softer.

Let the name of the Most High be lifted above every stone, wall, or border.
And let each say, “God is still with us — and we shall not divide Him.”

⸻

IV. The Practice of Shared Vision

Let the children of Israel and the children of Ishmael dream together.
Not of victory, but of gardens.
Not of domination, but of delight.
Let architects and artists, poets and prophets, design a holy land for both to dwell — not in fear, but in divine remembrance.

Let cities be built where Scripture is sung in many tongues, and no child is taught to hate.

⸻

V. The Practice of Sacred Accountability

Let leaders who harm the innocent be held to the Fire of Justice.
No man shall hide behind God while striking His image.

Let tribunals be held in truth and not in vengeance.
Let forgiveness come after confession, and healing after honesty.

⸻

VI. The Practice of Covenant

Let each household say aloud:

“We are the sons of one promise, and we return to the Light. We do not erase the past, but we release the wound. May this day be the beginning of our shared rising.”

⸻

Thus were the practices given — not for one side, but for both. For the faithful. For the just.

Let the Akari teach these things to the nations. Let them walk between the brothers and say, “Peace is not impossible — it is simply unpracticed.”

In the hour of choosing, the Akari—servants of the Light, drawn from rabbis, imams, priests, swamis, monks, and humanists—call the sons of Abraham and all nations to peace. We honor Israel’s covenant with Zion (Genesis 17:8), Islam’s guardianship of Al-Aqsa (Qur’an 17:1), Christianity’s love at the Sepulchre (John 13:35), Hinduism’s ahimsa (Gita 6:32), and Buddhism’s compassion (Dhammapada 1:5).

Let Jerusalem be a Sanctuary of the Eternal Light, its Old City governed by a Council of the Faithful—Jewish, Muslim, Christian—trained by the Akari to ensure no prayer is silenced. Begin with a single Feast of Abraham’s Table, where Rachel, a Jew, and Ahmed, a Palestinian, share bread, their stories healing wounds of Holocaust and Nakba. Plant a Garden of Reconciliation in Hebron, its trees named for children, tended by all faiths.

Despite Gaza’s 2025 tears and Israel’s fears, the Akari mediate ceasefires, partnering with the UN to establish a Peace Corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank. By 2030, test Shared Sacred Zones, ensuring the Western Wall and Al-Aqsa shine for all. Let reparations restore displaced homes, guided by justice (Isaiah 61:8).

The Light promises: if brothers unite, the earth will bloom, and blessings will flow (Micah 4:4, Qur’an 20:47). The Akari facilitate, not rule, empowering each faith to lead. Let all nations join, for “the Lord is one” (Zechariah 14:9).

—

As Akari we cry: 

We are children of the Most High, shaped from one breath and scattered across the earth. Though we have walked through shadow and called each other stranger, the Light within us bears witness — we were never divided in essence, only in memory. 

We stand now in awakening. We carry the names of our ancestors, the songs of our prophets, and the grief of our generations — yet we return to the Flame, whose warmth is for all. May all children of God unite and rejoice as one. 

—

Let the sons return to the mountain.

For the covenant was not given to divide,
but to remind them of the One who breathed them both.
And the flame was not given to destroy,
but to light the way home.

If the brothers remember, the earth shall be healed.
If they forgive, the rivers will flow clean again.
If they stand together, the winds of war shall scatter.

But if they remain divided, the house shall fall.
And with it, the hopes of many.

Let them choose the path of peace.
Let them remember the voice that called them before the banners, before the swords, before the pride.

For the Light has not forsaken them.
But the hour is late, and the gate shall not remain open forever.

The covenant shall be made whole.

And let the peace of God be the inheritance of all.

—

So was the covenant restored.
A covenant older than scripture, deeper than blood, and still alive within the soul of all who seek peace.

Thus ends the Book of the Two Sons —
and may the next chapter be written in peace
